Let's start with a simple stochastic optimization problem. Suppose $\ALPHABET
X$, $\ALPHABET U$, $\ALPHABET W$ are finite sets and let $X \in \ALPHABET X$
and $W \in \ALPHABET W$ be random variables defined on a common probability
space. A decision maker observes the realization of $X$ and chooses and
action $U \in \ALPHABET U$ according to a _decison rule_ $g$, i.e.,
$$ U = g(X) $$
and incurs a cost
$$J(g) = \EXP[ c(X, g(X), W) ],$$
where the expectation is taken with respect to the joint probability
distribution of $(X,W)$.

**The basic stochastic optimization problem** is
\begin{equation} \label{eq:basic}
  \min_{g} \EXP[ c(X, g(X), W) ] 
\end{equation}
i.e., choose a _function_ $g$ to minimize the _functional_ $J(g)$. 
:::

Problem \\ref{eq:basic} can be interpreted as follows. Before the system starts
running, the decision maker wants to pick a rule $g$ to determine an action
for each realization of his observation $X$. What rule should he pick to
minimize the expected cost?

At first glance, this appears to be a formidable optimization problem, but
there is an alternative way of viewing the problem that simplifies it
considerably. Instead of viewing the optimization problem before the system
starts running, imagine that the decision maker waits until he sees the
realization $x$ of $X$. He then asks what action $u$ should he take to
minimize the expected _conditional_ cost $\EXP[ c(x,u, W) | X = x]$, i.e., he
considers the problem

\begin{equation} \label{eq:cond-1}
  \min_{u \in \ALPHABET U} \EXP[ c(x,u,W) | X = x].
\end{equation}

In Problem \\ref{eq:cond-1} is a _parameter optimization problem_, which is
considerably simpler than Problem \\ref{eq:basic}, which is a _functional
optimization problem_.

Now define
$$ \begin{equation} \label{eq:cond}
  g^*(x) = \arg \min_{u \in \ALPHABET U} \EXP[ c(x,u, W) | X = x]
\end{equation} $$
where ties (in the minimization) are broken arbitarily. 

::: proclaim :::
**Basic fact.**
The decision rule $g^*$ defined in \\eqref{eq:cond} is optimal for Problem \\ref{eq:basic}.

Remark

:   In the beginning we restricted attention to $\ALPHABET X$, $\ALPHABET U$,
$\ALPHABET W$ being finite. This is to avoid any measurability issues. If
$\ALPHABET X$ and $\ALPHABET U$ are continuous sets, we need to restrict to
_measurable_ $g$ in Problem \\ref{eq:basic} (otherwise the expectation is not
well defined; of course the cost $c$ also has to be measurable). However, it
is not immediately obvious that $g^*$ defined in \\eqref{eq:cond} is measurable.
Conditions that ensure this are known as _measurable selection theorems_. 

## Proof

Let $g$ be any other decision rule. Then,
$$ \begin{align*}
  \EXP[ c(X, g(X), W) ] &\stackrel{(a)}= \EXP[ \EXP[c(X, g(X), W) | X ] ] \\
  &\stackrel{(b)}\ge \EXP[\EXP[ c(X, g^*(X), W) | X ] ] \\
  &\stackrel{(c)}= \EXP[ c(X, g^*(X), W) ],
\end{align*} $$
where $(a)$ and $(c)$ follow from the law of iterated expectations and $(b)$
follows from the definition of $g^*$ in \\eqref{eq:cond}. 

## Exercise

1. Suppose $\ALPHABET X = \{1, 2 \}$, $\ALPHABET U = \{1, 2, 3\}$, and $\ALPHABET
   W = \{1, 2, 3\}$. Let $X$ and $W$ be random variables taking values in
   $\ALPHABET X$ and $\ALPHABET W$ with joint distribution $P$ shown below.
    
   $$ P = \MATRIX{ 0.25 & 0.15 & 0.05  \\ 0.30 & 0.10 & 0.15 } $$

   Here the row corresponds to the value of $x$ and the column corresponds to
   the value of $w$. For example $\PR(X=2, W=1) = P_{21} = 0.30$. 

   The cost function $c \colon \ALPHABET X \times \ALPHABET U \times \ALPHABET
   W \to \reals$ is shown below

   $$
    c(\cdot,\cdot,1) = \MATRIX{3 & 5 & 1 \\ 2 & 3 & 1 }, \quad
    c(\cdot,\cdot,2) = \MATRIX{4 & 3 & 1 \\ 1 & 2 & 8 }, \quad
    c(\cdot,\cdot,3) = \MATRIX{1 & 2 & 2 \\ 4 & 1 & 3 }.
   $$

   Here the row corresponds to the value of $x$ and the column corresponds to
   the value of $u$. For example $c(x=1,u=2,w=1) = 5$. 

   Find the policy $g \colon \ALPHABET X \to \ALPHABET U$ that minimizes
   $\EXP[ c(X, g(X), W) ]$.
