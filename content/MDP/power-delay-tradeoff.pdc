TL;DR _This stylized example of power-delay trade-off in wireless
communications illustrates that a dynamic programming formulation can be used
to identify qualitative properties of the value function and optimal
policies._

---

In a cell phone, higher layer applications such as voicecall, email, browsers,
etc. generate data packets. These packets are buffered in a queue and the
transmission protocol decides how many packets to transmit at each time
depending the number of packets in the queue and the quality of the wireless
channel.

Let $X_t \in \integers_{\ge 0}$ denote the number of packets buffered at time
$t$ and $U_t \in \integers_{\ge 0}$, $U_t \le X_t$, denote the number of
packets transmitted at time $t$. The remaining $X_t - U_t$ packets incur a
delay penalty given by $d(X_t - U_t)$, where $d(\cdot)$ is a _strictly_
increasing and convex function where $d(0) = 0$. 

During time $t$, $W_t \in \integers_{\ge 0}$ additional packets arrive and 
$$ X_{t+1} = X_t - U_t + W_t.$$
We assume that $\{W_t\}_{t \ge 1}$ is an i.i.d. process.

The packets are transmitted over a wireless fading channel. Let $S_t \in
\ALPHABET S$ denote the state of the fading channel. We assume that
$\{S_t\}_{t \ge 1}$ is a [stochastically monotone][monotone] Markov process that is
independent of $\{W_t\}_{t \ge 1}$.

[monotone]: ../../theory/stochastic-dominance#stochastic-monotonicity

The transmission protocol sets the transmit power such that the signal to
noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver is above a desired threshold. It can be
shown that for additive white Gaussian channels (AWGN), the transmitted power
is of the form
$$p(U_t) q(S_t),$$
where 

* $p(\cdot)$ is a strictly increasing and convex function where $p(0) = 0$;
* $q(\cdot)$ is a strictly decreasing function.

The objective is to choose a transmission policy $U_t = g_t(X_t, S_t)$ to
minimize the weighted sum of transmitted power and delay
$$ \EXP\bigg[ \sum_{t=1}^T \big[ p(U_t) q(S_t) + \lambda d(X_t - U_t) \big]
\bigg],$$
where $\lambda$ may be viewed as a Lagrange multiplier corresponding to a
constrained optimization problem. 

## Dynamic program

We can assume $Y_t = X_t - U_t$ as a post-decision state in the above model
and write the dynamic program as follows:

$$ V_{T+1}(x,s) = 0 $$
and for $t \in \{T, \dots, 1\}$, 
$$\begin{align*}
  Q_t(y,s) &= \lambda d(y) + \EXP[ V_{t+1}(y + W_t, S_{t+1}) | S_t = s ], \\
  V_t(x,s) &= \min_{u \le x} \big\{ p(u) q(s) + Q_t(x-u, s) \big\}
\end{align*}$$

Lemma

:   For all $t$, $V_t(x,s)$ and $Q_t(y,s)$ are increasing in the first
    variable and decreasing in the second variable. 
:::

#### Proof

First note that the constraint set $\ALPHABET U(x) = \{0, \dots, x\}$
satisfies the conditions that generalize the result of monotonicity to
constrained actions. 

We prove the two monotonicity properties by backward induction. First note
that $V_{T+1}(x,s)$ is trivially monotone. This forms the basis of induction.
Now suppose $V_{t+1}(x,s)$ is increasing in $x$ and decreasing in $s$. Since
$\{S_t\}_{t \ge 1}$ is stochastically monotone, 
$$Q_t(y,s) = \lambda d(y) + \EXP[ V_{t+1}(y + W_t, S_{t+1}) | S_t = s ]$$
is decreasing in $s$. Moreover, since both $d(y)$ and $V_{t+1}(y + w, s)$ are
increasing in $y$, so is $Q_t(y,s)$.

Now, for every $u$, $p(u) q(s)$ and $Q_t(x-u, s)$ is increasing in $x$ and
decreasing in $s$. So, the pointwise minima over $u$ is also increasing in $x$
and decreasing in $s$.

Lemma

:   For all $t$ and $s$, $V_t(x,s)$ and $Q_t(y,s)$ are convex in the first
    variable.
:::

#### Proof

We proceed by backward induction. First note that $V_{T+1}(x,s)$ is trivially
convex in $x$. Now assume that $V_{t+1}(x,s)$ is convex in $x$. Then,
$\EXP[V_{t+1}(y + W_t, S_{t+1}) | S_t = s]$ is weighted sum of convex functions
and is, therefore, convex in $y$. Therefore, $Q_t(y,s)$ is a sum of two convex
functions and, therefore, covnex in $y$. 

We cannot directly show the convexity of $V_t(x,s)$ because the pointwise
minimum of convex functions is not convex. So, we consider the following
arguement. Fix $s$ and pick $x > 1$. Let $\underline u = g^*_t(x-1,s)$ and
$\bar u = g^*_t(x+1,s)$. Let $\underline v = \lfloor (\underline u + \bar u)/2
\rfloor$ and $\bar v = \lceil (\underline u + \bar u)/2
\rceil$. Note that both $\underline v$ and $\bar v$ are feasible at $x$. Then,
$$ \begin{align*}
  \hskip 2em & \hskip -2em
  V_t(x-1, s) + V_t(x+1, s)
  \\
  &= 
  [ p(\underline u) + p(\bar u) ] q(s) + Q_t(x - 1 - \underline u, s)
  + Q_t(x + 1 - \bar u, s)
  \\
  &\stackrel{(a)}\ge [ p(\underline v) + p(\bar v)] q(s) + 
    Q_t(x - \underline v, s) + Q_t(x - \bar v, s) \\
  &\ge 2 \min_{u \le x} \big\{ p(u) q(s) + Q_t(x-u, s) \\
  &= 2 V_t(x,s),
\end{align*} $$
where $(a)$ follows from convexity of $p(\cdot)$ and $Q_t(\cdot, s)$. Thus,
$V_t(x,s)$ is convex in $x$. This completes the induction step.

Theorem

:   For all $t$ and $s$, the optimal strategy $g^*_t(x,s)$ is increasing in
    $x$.
:::

#### Proof

In the previous lemma, we have shown that $Q_t(y,s)$ is convex
in $y$. Therefore, $Q_t(x-u, s)$ is submodular in $(x,u)$. 

[ One can show this by finite difference, but for simplicity, we assume that
$Q_t(y,s)$ is twice differentiable. Then, $\partial^2 Q_t(x - u, s)/ \partial
x \partial u \le 0$ (by convexity of $Q_t$). ]

Thus, for a fixed $s$, $p(u)q(s) + Q_t(x-u, s)$ is submodular in $(x,u)$.
Therefore, the optimal policy is increasing in $x$.

## Exercises

1. The purpose of this exercise is to establish the monotonicity of the
   optimal policy in the channel state.

    a. Show that for all $t$, $Q_t(y,s)$ is submodular in $(y,s)$.
    b. Use the result of the previous part to show that for any fixed $x$,
    $g_t^*(x,s)$ is increasing inÂ $s$.
