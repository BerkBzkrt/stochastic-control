      <description>Imagine a gambler who goes to a casino with an initial fortune of \(x_1\) dollars and places bets over time and must leave after \(T\) bets. Let \(X_t\) denote the gamblerâ€™s fortune after \(t\) bets. In this example, time denotes the number of times that the gambler has bet.
At time \(t\), the gambler may place a bet for any amount \(U_t\) less that his current fortune \(X_t\). If he wins the bet (denoted by the even \(W_t = 1\)), the casino gives him the amount that he had bet.</description>

      <description>Stochastic dominance is a partial order on random variables. Let \(\ALPHABET X\) be a totally ordered finite set, say \(\{1, \dots, n\}\) and let \(\Delta(\ALPHABET X)\) denote the state of pmfs on \(\ALPHABET X\).
 Definition Suppose \(X\) and \(Y\) are \(\ALPHABET X\) valued random variables where \(X \sim \pi\) and \(Y \sim \mu\). We say \(X\) stochastically dominates \(Y\) if for any \(x \in \ALPHABET X\), \[ \PR(X \ge x) \ge \PR(Y \ge x).</description>

      <description>Whenever possible, I will post notes on some of the material covered in class, but that is not guaranteed. This is a graduate class and you are responsible for taking notes in class and reading the appropriate chapters of the textbooks.
The notes will be updated as we move along in the course. Please check the dates on the first page to keep track. If you find any typos/mistakes in the notes, please let me know.</description>
