      <title>Optimal Gambling</title>

      <description>TL;DR This stylized model of optimal gambling was introduced by Kelly (1956) to highlight a relationship between channel capacity (which had been proposed recently by Shannon), and gambling. Our motivation for studying this model is to use it as an illustrative example to show that sometimes it is possible to identify the optimal strategy and value function of MDPs in closed form.
Imagine a gambler who goes to a casino with an initial fortune of \(x_1\) dollars and places bets over time and must leave after \(T\) bets.</description>

      <title>Inventory Management</title>

      <description>TL;DR The inventory management example illustrates that a dynamic programming formulation is useful even when a closed form solution does not exist. This model also introduces the idea of post-decision state, which is useful in many contexts.
Imagine a retail store that stockpiles products in its warehouse to meet random demand. Suppose the store procures new stocks at the end of each day (and that there is no lead time and stocks are available next morning).</description>

      <description>Stochastic dominance is a partial order on random variables. Let \(\ALPHABET X\) be a totally ordered finite set, say \(\{1, \dots, n\}\) and let \(\Delta(\ALPHABET X)\) denote the state of pmfs on \(\ALPHABET X\).
 Definition Suppose \(X\) and \(Y\) are \(\ALPHABET X\) valued random variables where \(X \sim \pi\) and \(Y \sim \mu\). We say \(X\) stochastically dominates \(Y\) if for any \(x \in \ALPHABET X\), \[ \PR(X \ge x) \ge \PR(Y \ge x).</description>

      <description>Whenever possible, I will post notes on some of the material covered in class, but that is not guaranteed. This is a graduate class and you are responsible for taking notes in class and reading the appropriate chapters of the textbooks.
The notes will be updated as we move along in the course. Please check the dates on the first page to keep track. If you find any typos/mistakes in the notes, please let me know.</description>

      <description>Definition A \(n \times n\) symmetric matrix \(M\) is called
 positive definite (written as \(M &amp;gt; 0\)) if for all \(x \in \reals^n\), \(x \neq 0\), we have \[x^\TRANS M x &amp;gt; 0.\]
 positive semi definite (written as \(M \ge 0\)) if for all \(x \in \reals^n\), \(x \neq 0\), we have \[x^\TRANS M x \ge 0.\]
    A symmetric matrix is positive definite (respt.</description>
