      <description>Note: To be consistent with the notation used in linear systems, we denote the state and action by lowercase \(x\) and \(u\), even for stochastic systems (unlike the notation used for other models where we use uppercase \(X\) and \(U\) for state and actions to emphasize the fact they are random variables).
We start by considering a determinisitc linear system with state \(x_t \in \reals^n\) and control actions \(u_t \in \reals^m\) and dynamics \[ x_{t+1} = A_t x_t + B_t u_t,\] where \(A_t \in \reals^{n \times n}\) and \(B_t \in \reals^{n \times m}\) are known matrices.</description>

      <title>Theory: Infinite horizon discounted MDP</title>

      <description>A common way to approximate systems that run for a very large horizon is to assume that they run for an infinite horizon. There is an inherent homogeneity over time for infinite horizon system: the future depends only on the current state and not on the current time. Due to this homogeneity over time, we expect that the optimal policy should also be time-homogeneous. Therefore, the optimal policy for an infinite-horizon system should be easier to implement than the optimal policy for a finite horizon system, especially so when the horizon is large.</description>

      <description>Let \(\{X_t\}_{t \ge 1}\) be a Markov chain. At each time \(t\), a decision maker observes the state \(X_t\) of the Markov chain and decides whether to continue or stop the process. If the decision maker decides to continue, he incurs a continuation cost \(c_t(X_t)\) and the state evolves. If the DM decides to stop, he incurs a stopping cost of \(s_t(X_t)\) and the problem is terminated. The objective is to determine an optimal stopping time \(\tau\) to minimize \[J(\tau) := \EXP\bigg[ \sum_{t=1}^{\tau-1} c_t(X_t) + s_\tau(X_\tau) \bigg].</description>

      <title>Example: Inventory Management (revisited)</title>

      <guid>https://adityam.github.io/stochastic-control/inf-mdp/inventory-management/</guid>
      <description>TL;DR One of the potential benefits of modeling a system as infinite horizon discounted cost MDP is that it can be simpler to identify an optimal policy. We illustrate this using the inventory management example.
Consider the model for inventory management and assume that it runs for an infinite horizon. We assume that the per-step cost is given by \[c(x,u,x_{+}) = p u + \beta h(x), \] where \[ h(x) = \begin{cases} ax, &amp;amp; \text{if $x \ge 0$} \\ -bx, &amp;amp; \text{if $x &amp;lt; 0$}, \end{cases}\] where \(a\) is the per-unit holding cost, \(b\) is the per-unit shortage cost, and \(p\) is the per-unit procurement cost.</description>

      <description>1 Preliminaries We first start with some properties of deterministic time-homogeous linear system: \[\begin{equation} \label{eq:simple} x_{t+1} = A x_{t-1}. \end{equation}\] The solution to this system is given by \(x_t = A^t x_0\). It obviously has an equilibrium point of \(x = 0\). This will be the unique equilibrium point if \(A\) is non-singular, when the only solution of \(x = Ax\) is \(x = 0\). Suppose this is true. One may now ask whether this equilibrium is stable in that \(x_t \to 0\) with increasing \(t\) for any \(x_0\).</description>

      <title>Example: Service Migration in Mobile Edge Computing</title>

      <guid>https://adityam.github.io/stochastic-control/inf-mdp/service-migration-in-mec/</guid>
      <description>TL;DR Another benefit of infinite horizon models is that it is possible to prove structural properties of the optimal policy which might not hold for a finite horizon model. We illustrate this using a model for serive migration in mobile edge computing.
There are many mobile applications which consist of a front-end component running on a mobile device and a back-end component running on a cloud, where the cloud provides additional data processing and computing resources.</description>

      <title>Theory: Linear Programming Formulation and Constrained MDPs</title>

      <description>Note: Throughout this section, we assume that \(\ALPHABET X\) and \(\ALPHABET U\) are finite and \(|\ALPHABET X|= n\) and \(|\ALPHABET U| = m\).
We know that if \(V \le \mathcal B V\) then \(V \le V^* = \mathcal B V^*\). Thus, \(V^*\) is the “largest” \(V\) that satisfies the constraint \(V \le \mathcal B V\). This constraint can be written as a finite system of linear equations: \[\begin{equation} \label{eq:constaints} V(x) \le c(x,u) + β\sum_{y \in \ALPHABET X} P(y|x,u) V(y), \qquad x \in \ALPHABET X, u \in \ALPHABET U.</description>

      <description>A decision maker (DM) wants to select the best alternative from a set of \(T\) alternatives. The DM evaluates the alternatives sequentially. After evaluating alternative \(t\), the DM knows whether alternative \(t\) was the best alternative so far or not. Based on this information, the DM must decide whether to choose alternative \(t\) and stop the search, or to permanently reject alternative \(t\) and evaluate remaining alternatives. The DM may reject the last alternative and not make a choice at all.</description>

      <description>Markov decision processes (MDP) are the simplest model of a stochastic control system. The dynamic behavior of an MDP is modeled by an equation of the form \[ \begin{equation} X_{t+1} = f_t(X_t, U_t, W_t) \label{eq:state} \end{equation}\] where \(X_t \in \ALPHABET X\) is the state, \(U_t \in \ALPHABET U\) is the control input, and \(W_t \in \ALPHABET W\) is the noise. An agent/controller observes the state and chooses the control input \(U_t\).</description>

      <description>An investor has a call option to buy one share of a stock at a fixed price \(p\) dollars and has \(T\) days to exercise this option. For simplicity, we assume that the investor makes a decision at the beginning of each day.
The investory may decide not to exercise the option but if he does exercise the option when the stock price is \(x\), he effectively gets \((x-p)\).
Assume that the price of the stoch varies with independent increments, i.</description>

      <description>1 Preliminaries 1.1 Lipschitz continuous functions Given two metric spaces \((\ALPHABET X, d_X)\) and \((\ALPHABET Y, d_Y)\), the Lipschitz constant of function \(f \colon \ALPHABET X \to \ALPHABET Y\) is defined by \[ \| f\|_{L} = \sup_{x_1 \neq x_2} \left\{ \frac{ d_Y(f(x_1), f(x_2)) } { d_X(x_1, x_2) } : x_1, x_2 \in \ALPHABET X \right\} \in [0, ∞]. \] The function is called Lipschitz continuous if its Lipschitz constant is finite.</description>

      <description>1 State quantization Consider an MDP with continuous state space \(\ALPHABET X\) and finite action space \(\ALPHABET U\). We denote this MDP by \(M = (\ALPHABET X, \ALPHABET U, c, p)\), where for simplicity we assume that the \(p\) is the density of the transition kernel.
Since the state space is continuous, in general, we cannot compute the value functions exactly. The simplest way to proceed is to discretize the state space \(\ALPHABET X\).</description>

      <description>Image credit: http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Gambling-ca-1800.jpg  TL;DR This stylized model of optimal gambling was introduced by Kelly (1956) to highlight a relationship between channel capacity (which had been proposed recently by Shannon), and gambling. Our motivation for studying this model is to use it as an illustrative example to show that sometimes it is possible to identify the optimal strategy and value function of MDPs in closed form.
Imagine a gambler who goes to a casino with an initial fortune of \(x_1\) dollars and places bets over time and must leave after \(T\) bets.</description>

      <description>Image credit: https://hbr.org/2015/06/inventory-management-in-the-age-of-big-data  TL;DR The inventory management example illustrates that a dynamic programming formulation is useful even when a closed form solution does not exist. This model also introduces the idea of post-decision state, which is useful in many contexts.
Imagine a retail store that stockpiles products in its warehouse to meet random demand. Suppose the store procures new stocks at the end of each day (and that there is no lead time and stocks are available next morning).</description>

Let’s start with the function model described earlier and assume that \(\ALPHABET X\) and \(\ALPHABET U\) are finite sets and that the cost function and the probability distribution of \(\{W_t\}_{t \ge 1}\) are time-homogeneous. Then, the following is a fundamental property of MDPs:</description>

      <description>The value and policy iteration algorithms for discounted cost MDPs rely on exact computation of the Bellman update \(W = \mathcal B V\) and the corresponding optimal policy \(g\) such that \(\mathcal B V = \mathcal B_g V\). Suppose we cannot compute these updates exactly, but can find approximate solutions \(W\) and \(g\) such that \[ \NORM{W - \mathcal B V} \le δ \quad\text{and}\quad \NORM{\mathcal B_g V - \mathcal B V} \le ε\] where \(δ\) and \(ε\) are positive constants.</description>

      <description>Consider the matrix formulation of MDPs and suppose the state space \(\ALPHABET X\) is totally ordered. In many applications, it is useful to know if the value function is increasing (or decreasing) in state.
 Theorem Consider an MDP where the state space \(\ALPHABET X\) is totally ordered. Suppose the following conditions are satisfied.
C1. For every \(u \in \ALPHABET U\), the per-step cost \(c_t(x,u)\) is weakly inceasing in \(x\).</description>

      <description>TL;DR This stylized example of power-delay trade-off in wireless communications illustrates that a dynamic programming formulation can be used to identify qualitative properties of the value function and optimal policies.
In a cell phone, higher layer applications such as voicecall, email, browsers, etc. generate data packets. These packets are buffered in a queue and the transmission protocol decides how many packets to transmit at each time depending the number of packets in the queue and the quality of the wireless channel.</description>

      <description>What are the conditions under which two MDPs which have the same dynamics but different cost functions have the same optimal policy? This is an important question in reinforcement learning (where one often shapes the reward function to speed up learning) and inverse reinforcement learning (where one learns the reward function from the behavior of an expert). The following result provides a complete answer to this question.
Let \(M^1\) and \(M^2\) denote two MDPs on the same state space \(\ALPHABET X\) and action space \(\ALPHABET U\).</description>

      <description>1 Preliminaries  Lemma 1 Suppose that \(Q(z,w)\) is a quadratic function of vectors \(z\) and \(w\), positive definite in \(w\).
Let \(Q_{ww} = ∂^2 Q(z,w)/∂w^2\). Since \(Q(z,w)\) is a quadratic function, \(Q_{ww}\) does not depend on \(z\). Since \(Q\) is positive definite in \(w\), \(Q_{ww} &amp;gt; 0\).
Suppose \(w \in \reals^r\). Define \(q = \log[ (2π)^{r/2} \det(Q_{ww})^{-1/2}]\). Then, for a fixed value of \(z\) \[ \int \exp\bigl[ -Q(z,w)\bigr] dw = \exp\bigl[ q - \inf_{w \in \reals^r} Q(z,w) \bigr].</description>
