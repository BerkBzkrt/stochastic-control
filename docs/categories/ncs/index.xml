      <description>Networked control systems (NCS) refer to systems where there a communication network between different components of the control system. In this section, we consider the simplest setup of a NCS where there is a communication channel between the sensor and the controller. There are multiple ways to model the communication channel and we choose the simplest model—the communication channel is an i.i.d. packet drop channel. The details will be explained later.</description>
