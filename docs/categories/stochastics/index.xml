      <description>Letâ€™s start with the simplest optimization problem. A decision maker has to choose an action \(a \in \ALPHABET A\). Upon choosing the action \(a\), the decision maker incurs a cost \(c(a)\). What action should the decision maker pick to minimize the cost?
Formally, the above optimization problem may be written as \[ \begin{equation} \label{eq:basic} \min_{a \in \ALPHABET A} c(a). \end{equation}\]
When the action space \(\ALPHABET A\) is finite, say \(\ALPHABET A = \{1, \dots, m\}\), solving the optimization problem \eqref{eq:basic} is conceptually straight-forward: enumerate the cost of all possible actions, i.</description>

      <description>Image credit: https://americangallery.wordpress.com/category/cafferty-james-h/  TL;DR The newsvendor problem is a simple model of stochastic optimization problem where a decision has to be made when there is uncertainty about the outcome. It also shows that for some stochastic optimization problems it is possible to obtain the qualitative properties of the nature of optimal solution.
Each morning, a newsvendor has to decide how many newspapers to buy before knowing the demand during the day.</description>

      <description>Stochastic dominance is a partial order on random variables. Let \(\ALPHABET X\) be a totally ordered finite set, say \(\{1, \dots, n\}\) and let \(\Delta(\ALPHABET X)\) denote the state of pmfs on \(\ALPHABET X\).
 Definition Suppose \(X\) and \(Y\) are \(\ALPHABET X\) valued random variables where \(X \sim \pi\) and \(Y \sim \mu\). We say \(X\) stochastically dominates \(Y\) if for any \(x \in \ALPHABET X\), \[\begin{equation}\label{eq:inc-prob} \PR(X \ge x) \ge \PR(Y \ge x).</description>
