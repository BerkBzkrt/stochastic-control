      <description>An important consideration in model-based RL is to determine how many samples are needed to identify an \(α\)-approximate solution (for a pre-specified accuracy level \(α\)). This is known as sample complexity of learning and is typically analyzed under the assumption that the learning agent has access to a generative model, i.e., a black box simulator that takes the current state and action profile as input and generates samples of the next state as output.</description>
