Letâ€™s start with the function model described earlier and assume that \(\ALPHABET X\) and \(\ALPHABET U\) are finite sets and that the cost function and the probability distribution of \(\{W_t\}_{t \ge 1}\) are time-homogeneous. Then, the following is a fundamental property of MDPs:</description>
