      <description>State quantization Consider an MDP with continuous state space \(\ALPHABET X\) and finite action space \(\ALPHABET U\). We denote this MDP by \(M = (\ALPHABET X, \ALPHABET U, c, p)\), where for simplicity we assume that the \(p\) is the density of the transition kernel.
Since the state space is continuous, in general, we cannot compute the value functions exactly. The simplest way to proceed is to discretize the state space \(\ALPHABET X\).</description>
