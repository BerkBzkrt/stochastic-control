      <description>The solution to the linear quadratic regulator scales quadratically with the dimension of the state space. In many applications such as demand response in smart grids, the different components of the state are exchangeable or symmetric. This symmetry can be exploited to obtain a simpler solution. We start by giving a formal definition of exchageability.
Consider a linear dynamical system with \(n\) components. Let \(x^i_t\) and \(u^i_t\) denote the state and control action of component \(i\).</description>
