      <description>Stochastic dominance is a partial order on random variables. Let \(\ALPHABET S\) be a totally ordered finite set, say \(\{1, \dots, n\}\) and let \(\Delta(\ALPHABET S)\) denote the state of pmfs on \(\ALPHABET S\).
 Definition  Suppose \(S^1\) and \(S^2\) are \(\ALPHABET S\) valued random variables where \(S^1 \sim \mu^1\) and \(S^2 \sim \mu^2\). We say \(S^1\) stochastically dominates \(S^2\) if for any \(s \in \ALPHABET S\), \[\begin{equation}\label{eq:inc-prob} \PR(S^1 \ge s) \ge \PR(S^2 \ge s).</description>

      <description>Consider the matrix formulation of MDPs and suppose the state space \(\ALPHABET S\) is totally ordered. In many applications, it is useful to know if the value function is increasing (or decreasing) in state.
 Theorem  Consider an MDP where the state space \(\ALPHABET S\) is totally ordered. Suppose the following conditions are satisfied.
C1. For every \(a \in \ALPHABET A\), the per-step cost \(c_t(s,a)\) is weakly inceasing in \(s\).</description>

      <title>Example: Power-delay trade-off in wireless communication</title>

      <description>TL;DR This stylized example of power-delay trade-off in wireless communications illustrates that a dynamic programming formulation can be used to identify qualitative properties of the value function and optimal policies.
In a cell phone, higher layer applications such as voicecall, email, browsers, etc. generate data packets. These packets are buffered in a queue and the transmission protocol decides how many packets to transmit at each time depending the number of packets in the queue and the quality of the wireless channel.</description>
