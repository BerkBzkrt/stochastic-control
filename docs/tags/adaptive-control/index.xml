      <description>Adaptive control is a umbrella term which is often used to describe algorithms which are able to control an unknown system (i.e., a system with unknown dynamics). In this section, we focus on adaptive control of linear systems. The simplest setup is as follows.
Consider a standard linear quadratic regulator where the dynamics are \[ x_{t+1} = A_θ x_t + B_θ u_t + w_t \] where the matrices \(A_θ\) and \(B_θ\) are parameterized by a parameter \(θ\) which takes values in a set \(Θ\).</description>
