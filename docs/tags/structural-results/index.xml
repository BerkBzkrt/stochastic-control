      <description>TL;DR The inventory management example illustrates that a dynamic programming formulation is useful even when a closed form solution does not exist. This model also introduces the idea of post-decision state, which is useful in many contexts.
Imagine a retail store that stockpiles products in its warehouse to meet random demand. Suppose the store procures new stocks at the end of each day (and that there is no lead time and stocks are available next morning).</description>

      <description>In a cell phone, higher layer applications such as voicecall, email, browsers, etc. generate data packets. These packets are buffered in a queue and the transmission protocol decides how many packets to transmit at each time depending the number of packets in the queue and the quality of the wireless channel.
Let \(X_t \in \integers_{\ge 0}\) denote the number of packets buffered at time \(t\) and \(U_t \in \integers_{\ge 0}\), \(U_t \le X_t\), denote the number of packets transmitted at time \(t\).</description>
