      <description>Consider the matrix formulation of MDPs and suppose the state space \(\ALPHABET X\) is totally ordered. In many applications, it is useful to know if the value function is increasing (or decreasing) in state.
 Theorem Consider an MDP where the state space \(\ALPHABET X\) is totally ordered. Suppose the following conditions are satisfied.
C1. For every \(u \in \ALPHABET U\), the per-step cost \(c_t(x,u)\) is weakly inceasing in \(x\).</description>
