      <description>TL;DR This stylized model of optimal gambling was introduced by Kelly (1956) to highlight a relationship between channel capacity (which had been proposed recently by Shannon), and gambling. Our motivation for studying this model is to use it as an illustrative example to show that sometimes it is possible to identify the optimal strategy and value function of MDPs in closed form.
Imagine a gambler who goes to a casino with an initial fortune of \(x_1\) dollars and places bets over time and must leave after \(T\) bets.</description>
