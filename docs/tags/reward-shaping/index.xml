      <description>TL;DR One of the potential benefits of modeling a system as infinite horizon discounted cost MDP is that it can be simpler to identify an optimal policy. We illustrate this using the inventory management example.
Consider the model for inventory management and assume that it runs for an infinite horizon. We assume that the per-step cost is given by \[c(x,u,x_{+}) = p u + \beta h(x), \] where \[ h(x) = \begin{cases} ax, &amp;amp; \text{if $x \ge 0$} \\ -bx, &amp;amp; \text{if $x &amp;lt; 0$}, \end{cases}\] where \(a\) is the per-unit holding cost, \(b\) is the per-unit shortage cost, and \(p\) is the per-unit procurement cost.</description>

      <description>What are the conditions under which two MDPs which have the same dynamics but different cost functions have the same optimal policy? This is an important question in reinforcement learning (where one often shapes the reward function to speed up learning) and inverse reinforcement learning (where one learns the reward function from the behavior of an expert). The following result provides a complete answer to this question.
Let \(M^1\) and \(M^2\) denote two MDPs on the same state space \(\ALPHABET X\) and action space \(\ALPHABET U\).</description>
