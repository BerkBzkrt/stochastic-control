      <description>Risk sensitivity is relative to the idea of utility. The value of a sum of money \(x\) to a decision maker may not be proportional to \(x\) itself but may be some general increasing function \(\mathsf{U}(x)\), known as the utility function. For example, in the example on optimal gambling considered earlier, we had assumed that the utility for wealth \(x\) is \(\log x\). If a decision maker has utility function \(\mathsf{U}\), then the value of a random outcome \(X\) will be defined by the expected utility \(\EXP[\mathsf{U}(X)]\).</description>

      <description>1 Preliminaries  Lemma 1 Suppose that \(Q(z,w)\) is a quadratic function of vectors \(z\) and \(w\), positive definite in \(w\).
Let \(Q_{ww} = ∂^2 Q(z,w)/∂w^2\). Since \(Q(z,w)\) is a quadratic function, \(Q_{ww}\) does not depend on \(z\). Since \(Q\) is positive definite in \(w\), \(Q_{ww} &amp;gt; 0\).
Suppose \(w \in \reals^r\). Define \(q = \log[ (2π)^{r/2} \det(Q_{ww})^{-1/2}]\). Then, for a fixed value of \(z\) \[ \int \exp\bigl[ -Q(z,w)\bigr] dw = \exp\bigl[ q - \inf_{w \in \reals^r} Q(z,w) \bigr].</description>
