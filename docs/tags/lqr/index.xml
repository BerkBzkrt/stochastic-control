      <description>Note: To be consistent with the notation used in linear systems, we denote the state and action by lowercase \(x\) and \(u\), even for stochastic systems (unlike the notation used for other models where we use uppercase \(X\) and \(U\) for state and actions to emphasize the fact they are random variables).
We start by considering a determinisitc linear system with state \(x_t \in \reals^n\) and control actions \(u_t \in \reals^m\) and dynamics \[ x_{t+1} = A_t x_t + B_t u_t,\] where \(A_t \in \reals^{n \times n}\) and \(B_t \in \reals^{n \times m}\) are known matrices.</description>

      <title>Simplest model of a network controlled systems</title>

      <description>Networked control systems (NCS) refer to systems where there a communication network between different components of the control system. In this section, we consider the simplest setup of a NCS where there is a communication channel between the sensor and the controller. There are multiple ways to model the communication channel and we choose the simplest model—the communication channel is an i.i.d. packet drop channel. The details will be explained later.</description>
