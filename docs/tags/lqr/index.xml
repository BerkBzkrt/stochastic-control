      <description>Note: To be consistent with the notation used in linear systems, we denote the state and action by lowercase \(x\) and \(u\), even for stochastic systems (unlike the notation used for other models where we use uppercase \(X\) and \(U\) for state and actions to emphasize the fact they are random variables).
We start by considering a determinisitc linear system with state \(x_t \in \reals^n\) and control actions \(u_t \in \reals^m\) and dynamics \[ x_{t+1} = A_t x_t + B_t u_t,\] where \(A_t \in \reals^{n \times n}\) and \(B_t \in \reals^{n \times m}\) are known matrices.</description>

      <description>Adaptive control is a umbrella term which is often used to describe algorithms which are able to control an unknown system (i.e., a system with unknown dynamics). In this section, we focus on adaptive control of linear systems. The simplest setup is as follows.
Consider a standard linear quadratic regulator where the dynamics are \[ x_{t+1} = A_θ x_t + B_θ u_t + w_t \] where the matrices \(A_θ\) and \(B_θ\) are parameterized by a parameter \(θ\) which takes values in a set \(Θ\).</description>

      <description>1 Preliminaries We first start with some properties of deterministic time-homogeous linear system: \[\begin{equation} \label{eq:simple} x_{t+1} = A x_{t-1}. \end{equation}\] The solution to this system is given by \(x_t = A^t x_0\). It obviously has an equilibrium point of \(x = 0\). This will be the unique equilibrium point if \(A\) is non-singular, when the only solution of \(x = Ax\) is \(x = 0\). Suppose this is true. One may now ask whether this equilibrium is stable in that \(x_t \to 0\) with increasing \(t\) for any \(x_0\).</description>

      <description>Consider a stochastic linear system as in the case of LQR. The system has state \(x_t \in \reals^n\) and actions \(u_t \in \reals^m\). The initial state \(x_1\) has zero mean and finite variance \(\Sigma^x_1\). The system dynamics are given by \[ x_{t+1} = A_t x_t + B_t u_t + w_t, \] where \(A_t \in \reals^{n×n}\) and \(B_t \in \reals^{n×m}\) are known matrices and \(\{w_t\}_{t \ge 1}\) is \(\reals^n\)-valued i.i.d. noise process with zero mean and finite variance \(\Sigma^w\).</description>

      <description>Networked control systems (NCS) refer to systems where there a communication network between different components of the control system. In this section, we consider the simplest setup of a NCS where there is a communication channel between the sensor and the controller. There are multiple ways to model the communication channel and we choose the simplest model—the communication channel is an i.i.d. packet drop channel. The details will be explained later.</description>

      <description>In this section, we extend the model of a simple NCS to one where there a cost associated with sending data from the sensor to the controller. This cost may be due to considerations of transmit power at the sensor or it may be a viewed as a Lagrange multiplier if multiple sensors are sharing the same communication channel with limited bandwidth.
As before, we consider a linear system with state \(x_t \in \reals^n\) and control action \(u_t \in \reals^n\) where the initial state \(x_1\) has zero mean and finite variance \(Σ^x_1\).</description>

      <description>1 Preliminaries  Lemma 1 Suppose that \(Q(z,w)\) is a quadratic function of vectors \(z\) and \(w\), positive definite in \(w\).
Let \(Q_{ww} = ∂^2 Q(z,w)/∂w^2\). Since \(Q(z,w)\) is a quadratic function, \(Q_{ww}\) does not depend on \(z\). Since \(Q\) is positive definite in \(w\), \(Q_{ww} &amp;gt; 0\).
Suppose \(w \in \reals^r\). Define \(q = \log[ (2π)^{r/2} \det(Q_{ww})^{-1/2}]\). Then, for a fixed value of \(z\) \[ \int \exp\bigl[ -Q(z,w)\bigr] dw = \exp\bigl[ q - \inf_{w \in \reals^r} Q(z,w) \bigr].</description>
