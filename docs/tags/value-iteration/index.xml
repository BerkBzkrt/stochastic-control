      <description>A common way to approximate systems that run for a very large horizon is to assume that they run for an infinite horizon. There is an inherent homogeneity over time for infinite horizon system: the future depends only on the current state and not on the current time. Due to this homogeneity over time, we expect that the optimal policy should also be time-homogeneous. Therefore, the optimal policy for an infinite-horizon system should be easier to implement than the optimal policy for a finite horizon system, especially so when the horizon is large.</description>

      <description>How many computations are needed to run the value or policy iteration algorithm to obtain a policy that in within \(ε\) of the optimal? In this section, we provide an answer for this question for the value iteration algorithm.
Conisder an MDP with a finite state space \(\ALPHABET X = \{1, \dots, n \}\) with a finite non-empty set of actions \(\ALPHABET U(x)\) available at each \(x \in \ALPHABET X\). Each action set consists of \(M_x\) actions with a total number of \(M = \sum_{x=1}^n M_x\) actions.</description>

      <description>The value and policy iteration algorithms for discounted cost MDPs rely on exact computation of the Bellman update \(W = \mathcal B V\) and the corresponding optimal policy \(g\) such that \(\mathcal B V = \mathcal B_g V\). Suppose we cannot compute these updates exactly, but can find approximate solutions \(W\) and \(g\) such that \[ \NORM{W - \mathcal B V} \le δ \quad\text{and}\quad \NORM{\mathcal B_g V - \mathcal B V} \le ε\] where \(δ\) and \(ε\) are positive constants.</description>
