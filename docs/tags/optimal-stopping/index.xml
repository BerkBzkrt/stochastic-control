      <description>Consider an optimal stopping problem and define the benefit function as the expected benefit1 of delaying the stopping decision at time \(t\), i.e., \[\begin{equation}\label{eq:B} B_t(x) = c_t(x) + \EXP[ V_{t+1}( X_{t+1} | X_t = x] - s_t(x). \end{equation}\] Thus, it is optimal to stop whenever \(B_t(x) \ge 0\).
Note that, we can write the value function in terms of the benefit function as follows: \[\begin{align} V_t(x) &amp;amp;= \min\{ s_t(x), B_t(x) + s_t(x) \} \nonumber \\ &amp;amp;= s_t(x) + [ B_t(x) ]^-, \label{eq:V} \end{align}\] where \([y]^-\) is a short hand for \(\min\{y, 0\}\).</description>

      <title>Example: Optimal choice of the best alternative</title>

      <description>A decision maker (DM) wants to select the best alternative from a set of \(T\) alternatives. The DM evaluates the alternatives sequentially. After evaluating alternative \(t\), the DM knows whether alternative \(t\) was the best alternative so far or not. Based on this information, the DM must decide whether to choose alternative \(t\) and stop the search, or to permanently reject alternative \(t\) and evaluate remaining alternatives. The DM may reject the last alternative and not make a choice at all.</description>

      <title>Example: Call options</title>

      <description>An investor has a call option to buy one share of a stock at a fixed price \(p\) dollars and has \(T\) days to exercise this option. For simplicity, we assume that the investor makes a decision at the beginning of each day.
The investory may decide not to exercise the option but if he does exercise the option when the stock price is \(x\), he effectively gets \((x-p)\).
Assume that the price of the stoch varies with independent increments, i.</description>
