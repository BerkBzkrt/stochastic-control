      <description>Letâ€™s start with the simplest optimization problem. A decision maker has to choose an action \(u \in \ALPHABET U\). Upon choosing action \(u\), the decision maker incurs a cost \(c(u)\). What action should the decision maker pick to minimize the cost?
Formally, the above optimization problem may be written as \[ \begin{equation} \label{eq:static-optimization} \min_{u \in \ALPHABET U} c(u). \end{equation}\]
When the action space \(\ALPHABET U\) is finite, say \(\ALPHABET U = \{1, \dots, m\}\), solving the optimization problem \eqref{eq:static-optimization} is straight-forward: enumerate the cost of all possible actions, i.</description>

      <description>TL;DR The newsvendor problem is a simple model of stochastic optimization problem where a decision has to be made when there is uncertainty about the outcome.
Each morning, a newsvendor has to decide how many newspapers to buy before knowing the demand during the day. The newsvendor purchases a newspaper at a cost of \(\$a\) per newspaper and sells them at a cost of \(\$b\) per newspaper, where \(b &amp;gt; a\).</description>
