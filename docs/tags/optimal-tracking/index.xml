      <description>Note: To be consistent with the notation used in linear systems, we denote the state and action by lowercase \(x\) and \(u\), even for stochastic systems (unlike the notation used for other models where we use uppercase \(X\) and \(U\) for state and actions to emphasize the fact they are random variables).
We start by considering a determinisitc linear system with state \(x_t \in \reals^n\) and control actions \(u_t \in \reals^m\) and dynamics \[ x_{t+1} = A_t x_t + B_t u_t,\] where \(A_t \in \reals^{n \times n}\) and \(B_t \in \reals^{n \times m}\) are known matrices.</description>

      <description>1 Preliminaries We first start with some properties of deterministic time-homogeous linear system: \[\begin{equation} \label{eq:simple} x_{t+1} = A x_{t-1}. \end{equation}\] The solution to this system is given by \(x_t = A^t x_0\). It obviously has an equilibrium point of \(x = 0\). This will be the unique equilibrium point if \(A\) is non-singular, when the only solution of \(x = Ax\) is \(x = 0\). Suppose this is true. One may now ask whether this equilibrium is stable in that \(x_t \to 0\) with increasing \(t\) for any \(x_0\).</description>
