      <description>1 State quantization Consider an MDP with continuous state space \(\ALPHABET X\) and finite action space \(\ALPHABET U\). We denote this MDP by \(M = (\ALPHABET X, \ALPHABET U, c, p)\), where for simplicity we assume that the \(p\) is the density of the transition kernel.
Since the state space is continuous, in general, we cannot compute the value functions exactly. The simplest way to proceed is to discretize the state space \(\ALPHABET X\).</description>

      <description>The value and policy iteration algorithms for discounted cost MDPs rely on exact computation of the Bellman update \(W = \mathcal B V\) and the corresponding optimal policy \(g\) such that \(\mathcal B V = \mathcal B_g V\). Suppose we cannot compute these updates exactly, but can find approximate solutions \(W\) and \(g\) such that \[ \NORM{W - \mathcal B V} \le δ \quad\text{and}\quad \NORM{\mathcal B_g V - \mathcal B V} \le ε\] where \(δ\) and \(ε\) are positive constants.</description>
