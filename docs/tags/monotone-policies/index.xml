      <description>Consider the matrix formulation of MDPs and suppose the state space \(\ALPHABET X\) is totally ordered. In many applications, it is useful to know if the value function is increasing (or decreasing) in state.
 Theorem Consider an MDP where the state space \(\ALPHABET X\) is totally ordered. Suppose the following conditions are satisfied.
C1. For every \(u \in \ALPHABET U\), the per-step cost \(c_t(x,u)\) is weakly inceasing in \(x\).</description>

      <title>Theory: Optimality of threshold policies in optimal stopping</title>

      <description>Consider an optimal stopping problem and define the benefit function as the expected benefit1 of delaying the stopping decision at time \(t\), i.e., \[\begin{equation}\label{eq:B} B_t(x) = c_t(x) + \EXP[ V_{t+1}( X_{t+1} | X_t = x] - s_t(x). \end{equation}\] Thus, it is optimal to stop whenever \(B_t(x) \ge 0\).
Note that, we can write the value function in terms of the benefit function as follows: \[\begin{align} V_t(x) &amp;amp;= \min\{ s_t(x), B_t(x) + s_t(x) \} \nonumber \\ &amp;amp;= s_t(x) + [ B_t(x) ]^-, \label{eq:V} \end{align}\] where \([y]^-\) is a short hand for \(\min\{y, 0\}\).</description>
