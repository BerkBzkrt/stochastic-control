      <description>Imagine a gambler who goes to a casino with an initial fortune of \(x_1\) dollars and places bets over time and must leave after \(T\) bets. Let \(X_t\) denote the gamblerâ€™s fortune after \(t\) bets. In this example, time denotes the number of times that the gambler has bet.
At time \(t\), the gambler may place a bet for any amount \(U_t\) less that his current fortune \(X_t\). If he wins the bet (denoted by the even \(W_t = 1\)), the casino gives him the amount that he had bet.</description>
