      <description>A common way to approximate systems that run for a very large horizon is to assume that they run for an infinite horizon. There is an inherent homogeneity over time for infinite horizon system: the future depends only on the current state and not on the current time. Due to this homogeneity over time, we expect that the optimal policy should also be time-homogeneous. Therefore, the optimal policy for an infinite-horizon system should be easier to implement than the optimal policy for a finite horizon system, especially so when the horizon is large.</description>
