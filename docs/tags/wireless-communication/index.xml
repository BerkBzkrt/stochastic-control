      <description>TL;DR Another benefit of infinite horizon models is that it is possible to prove structural properties of the optimal policy which might not hold for a finite horizon model. We illustrate this using a model for serive migration in mobile edge computing.
There are many mobile applications which consist of a front-end component running on a mobile device and a back-end component running on a cloud, where the cloud provides additional data processing and computing resources.</description>
