      <description>Risk sensitivity is relative to the idea of utility. The value of a sum of money \(x\) to a decision maker may not be proportional to \(x\) itself but may be some general increasing function \(\mathsf{U}(x)\), known as the utility function. For example, in the example on optimal gambling considered earlier, we had assumed that the utility for wealth \(x\) is \(\log x\). If a decision maker has utility function \(\mathsf{U}\), then the value of a random outcome \(X\) will be defined by the expected utility \(\EXP[\mathsf{U}(X)]\).</description>
