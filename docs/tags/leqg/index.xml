      <description>Risk sensitivity is relative to the idea of utility. The value of a sum of money \(z\) to a decision maker may not be proportional to \(z\) itself but may be some general increasing function \(\mathsf{U}(z)\), known as the utility function. For example, in the example on optimal gambling considered earlier, we had assumed that the utility for wealth \(z\) is \(\log z\). If a decision maker has utility function \(\mathsf{U}\), then the value of a random outcome \(Z\) will be defined by the expected utility \(\EXP[\mathsf{U}(Z)]\).</description>
