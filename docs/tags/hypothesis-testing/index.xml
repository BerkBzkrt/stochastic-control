      <description>Consider a decision maker (DM) that makes a series of i.i.d. observations which may be distributed according to PDF \(f_0\) or \(f_1\). Let \(Y_t\) denote the observaion at time \(t\). The DM wants to differentiate between two hypothesis: \[\begin{gather*} h_0 : Y_t \sim f_0 \\ h_1 : Y_t \sim f_1 \end{gather*}\] Typically, we think of \(h_0\) as the normal situation (or the null hypothesis) and \(h_1\) as an anomaly. For example, the hypothesis may be \[ h_0: Y_t \sim {\cal N}(0, σ^2) \quad h_1: Y_t \sim {\cal N}(μ, σ^2) \] or \[ h_0: Y_t \sim \text{Ber}(p) \quad h_1: Y_t \sim \text{Ber}(q).</description>
