      <description>TL;DR This stylized model of optimal gambling was introduced by Kelly (1956) to highlight a relationship between channel capacity (which had been proposed recently by Shannon), and gambling. Our motivation for studying this model is to use it as an illustrative example to show that sometimes it is possible to identify the optimal strategy and value function of MDPs in closed form.
Imagine a gambler who goes to a casino with an initial fortune of \(x_1\) dollars and places bets over time and must leave after \(T\) bets.</description>

      <description>TL;DR The inventory management example illustrates that a dynamic programming formulation is useful even when a closed form solution does not exist. This model also introduces the idea of post-decision state, which is useful in many contexts.
Imagine a retail store that stockpiles products in its warehouse to meet random demand. Suppose the store procures new stocks at the end of each day (and that there is no lead time and stocks are available next morning).</description>
