      <description>A common way to approximate systems that run for a very large horizon is to assume that they run for an infinite horizon. There is an inherent homogeneity over time for infinite horizon system: the future depends only on the current state and not on the current time. Due to this homogeneity over time, we expect that the optimal policy should also be time-homogeneous. Therefore, the optimal policy for an infinite-horizon system should be easier to implement than the optimal policy for a finite horizon system, especially so when the horizon is large.</description>

      <description>TL;DR One of the potential benefits of modeling a system as infinite horizon discounted cost MDP is that it can be simpler to identify an optimal policy. We illustrate this using the inventory management example.
Consider the model for inventory management and assume that it runs for an infinite horizon. We assume that the per-step cost is given by \[c(x,u,x_{+}) = p u + \beta h(x), \] where \[ h(x) = \begin{cases} ax, &amp;amp; \text{if $x \ge 0$} \\ -bx, &amp;amp; \text{if $x &amp;lt; 0$}, \end{cases}\] where \(a\) is the per-unit holding cost, \(b\) is the per-unit shortage cost, and \(p\) is the per-unit procurement cost.</description>

      <description>Preliminaries Lipschitz continuous functions Given two metric spaces \((\ALPHABET X, d_X)\) and \((\ALPHABET Y, d_Y)\), the Lipschitz constant of function \(f \colon \ALPHABET X \to \ALPHABET Y\) is defined by \[ \| f\|_{L} = \sup_{x_1 \neq x_2} \left\{ \frac{ d_Y(f(x_1), f(x_2)) } { d_X(x_1, x_2) } : x_1, x_2 \in \ALPHABET X \right\} \in [0, ∞]. \] The function is called Lipschitz continuous if its Lipschitz constant is finite.
Intuitively, a Lipschitz continuous function is limited by how fast it can change.</description>

      <title>Theory: State aggregation in MDPs</title>

      <description>State quantization Consider an MDP with continuous state space \(\ALPHABET X\) and finite action space \(\ALPHABET U\). We denote this MDP by \(M = (\ALPHABET X, \ALPHABET U, c, p)\), where for simplicity we assume that the \(p\) is the density of the transition kernel.
Since the state space is continuous, in general, we cannot compute the value functions exactly. The simplest way to proceed is to discretize the state space \(\ALPHABET X\).</description>

      <description>The value and policy iteration algorithms for discounted cost MDPs rely on exact computation of the Bellman update \(W = \mathcal B V\) and the corresponding optimal policy \(g\) such that \(\mathcal B V = \mathcal B_g V\). Suppose we cannot compute these updates exactly, but can find approximate solutions \(W\) and \(g\) such that \[ \NORM{W - \mathcal B V} \le δ \quad\text{and}\quad \NORM{\mathcal B_g V - \mathcal B V} \le ε\] where \(δ\) and \(ε\) are positive constants.</description>
