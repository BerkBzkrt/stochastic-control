      <description>Inventory Management. Consider a variation of the inventory management problem considered in class. Suppose that the inventory \(S_t\) and the actions \(A_t\) takes values in the set \(\mathbb S = \{0, 1, \dots, L \}\), and the dynamics are given by \[ S_{t+1} = \bigl[ S_t + A_t - W_t \bigr]_0^L, \] where \([ s ]_{0}^L\) is a function which clips the values between \(0\) and \(L\), i.e., \[ [ s ]_0^L = \begin{cases} 0, &amp;amp; \text{if $s &amp;lt; 0$} \\ s, &amp;amp; \text{if $0 \le s \le L$} \\ L, &amp;amp; \text{if $s &amp;gt; L$}.</description>

      <description>Service rate control in queueing systems
Consider a queueing system in which jobs arrive according to a i.i.d. Bernoulli process \(\{A_t\}_{t \ge 1}\), where \(\PR(A_t = 1) = q\). The jobs are queued in a buffer of size \(n\). Let \(X_t \in \{0, 1, \dots, n\}\) denote the number of jobs in the queue at time \(t\).
At each time, if there are jobs in the queue, the server works on the job at the head of the queue at service rate \(U_t \in \{0, 1, \dots, m\}\) and finishes the job with probability \(p(u)\).</description>
