      <description>Exercise 1 from the notes on stochastic optimization. Write a computer program in any language of your choice to find the optimal policy. You must submit your code along with your solution.
 Exercise 2 from the notes on stochastic optimization. Write a computer program in any language of your choice to find the optimal policy. You must submit your code along with your solution.

      <description>AM-GM inequality. Consider the problem of maximizing \[ V_t(a) = \max_{(u_1, \dots, u_t) \in \ALPHABET S_t(a)} u_1 ⋅ u_2 \cdots u_t \] where the region \(\ALPHABET S_t(a)\) is determined by the conditions \[ \sum_{i=1}^n u_i = a \quad \text{and} \quad u_i \ge 0. \]
Prove that \(V_t\) satisfies the following recursion \[ V_t(a) = \max_{u \in [0,a]} x ⋅ V_{n- 1}(a - u), \quad n &amp;gt; 1 \] with \(V_1(a) = a\).</description>
