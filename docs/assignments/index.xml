      <description>Exercise 1 from the notes on stochastic optimization. Write a computer program in any language of your choice to find the optimal policy. You must submit your code along with your solution.
 Exercise 2 from the notes on stochastic optimization. Write a computer program in any language of your choice to find the optimal policy. You must submit your code along with your solution.

      <description>AM-GM inequality. Consider the problem of maximizing \[ V_t(a) = \max_{(u_1, \dots, u_t) \in \ALPHABET S_t(a)} u_1 ⋅ u_2 \cdots u_t \] where the region \(\ALPHABET S_t(a)\) is determined by the conditions \[ \sum_{i=1}^t u_i = a \quad \text{and} \quad u_i \ge 0. \]
Prove that \(V_t\) satisfies the following recursion \[ V_t(a) = \max_{u \in [0,a]} u ⋅ V_{t- 1}(a - u), \quad t &amp;gt; 1 \] with \(V_1(a) = a\).</description>

      <description>Servince rate control in queueing systems
Consider a queueing system in which jobs arrive according to a i.i.d. Bernoulli process \(\{A_t\}_{t \ge 1}\), where \(\PR(A_t = 1) = q\). The jobs are queued in a buffer of size \(n\). Let \(X_t \in \{0, 1, \dots, n\}\) denote the number of jobs in the queue at time \(t\).
At each time, if there are jobs in the queue, the server works on the job at the head of the queue at service rate \(U_t \in \{0, 1, \dots, m\}\) and finishes the job with probability \(p(u)\).</description>
