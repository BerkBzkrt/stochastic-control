      <description>Execrise 1 from the notes on stochastic optimization. You may either do the caculations by hand or write a computer program in any language of your choice to find the optimal policy. Show the intermediate steps in both cases. If you solve the problem by writing a computer program, you must submit your code along with your solution.
 Exercises 3 from the notes on optimal gambling. You may assume the results of Exercises 1 and 2.</description>

      <description>Monotonicity in time. Suppose that the per-step cost \(c_t(\cdot)\) is time-homogeneous (except, possibly at the terminal time \(t=T\)). Suppose we have that \(J_{T-1}(x) \le J_T(x)\) for all \(x \in \ALPHABET S\). Then, show that \[ J_{t}(x) \le J_{t+1}(x), \quad \text{for all $x \in \ALPHABET X$ and $t$}.\]
Similarly, if we have that \(J_{T-1}(x) \ge J_T(x)\) for all \(x \in \ALPHABET X\), then \[ J_{t}(x) \ge J_{t+1}(x), \quad \text{for all $x \in \ALPHABET X$ and $t$}.</description>
