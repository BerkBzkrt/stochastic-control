      <description>Execrise 1 from the notes on stochastic optimization. You may either do the caculations by hand or write a computer program in any language of your choice to find the optimal policy. Show the intermediate steps in both cases. If you solve the problem by writing a computer program, you must submit your code along with your solution.
 Exercises 3 from the notes on optimal gambling. You may assume the results of Exercises 1 and 2.</description>

      <description>Monotonicity in time. Suppose that the dynamics is time homogeneous and so is the per-step cost \(c_t(\cdot)\) (except, possibly at the terminal time \(t=T\)). Suppose we have that \(V_{T-1}(x) \le V_T(x)\) for all \(x \in \ALPHABET S\). Then, show that \[ V_{t}(x) \le V_{t+1}(x), \quad \text{for all $x \in \ALPHABET X$ and $t$}.\]
Similarly, if we have that \(V_{T-1}(x) \ge V_T(x)\) for all \(x \in \ALPHABET X\), then \[ V_{t}(x) \ge V_{t+1}(x), \quad \text{for all $x \in \ALPHABET X$ and $t$}.</description>

      <description>Servince rate control
Consider a queueing system. Jobs entering the system are buffered and served in a first come first serve basis. During each epoch, a server works on the jobs and the number of completed jobs depend on the service rate.
Let \(X_t \in \integers_{\ge 0}\) denote the number of jobs at the beginning of time \(t\), \(Y_t \in \integers_{\ge 0}\) denotes the number of jobs completed during time \(t\), and \(W_t \in \integers_{\ge 0}\) denotes the number of new jobs that arrive during time \(t\).</description>

      <description>A hunter is interested in optimal scheduling of hunting during an expedition that may last up to \(T\) days. The hunter has two options on each day: he may go out to hunt or he may decide to stop the expedition and go back home.
 Going out to hunt costs \(c\) units per day with the possibility of capturing one animal. The probability of capture depends on the population \(n\): probability of a capture is \(p(n)\); probability of no capture is \(1 - p(n)\).</description>
