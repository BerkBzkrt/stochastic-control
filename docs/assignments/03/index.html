<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Service rate control in queueing systems</strong></p>
<p>Consider a queueing system where <span class="math inline">\(S_t \in \{0, 1, \dots, n\}\)</span> denotes the number of jobs in the queue at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(W_t \in \integers_{\ge 0}\)</span> denotes the number of new job arrivals in time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(Z_t \in \{0,1\}\)</span> denotes whether the job being processed gets completed in time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. The dynamics of the system are given by <span class="math display">\[
   S_{t+1} = \bigl[ [ S_t - Z_t]^{+} + W_t \bigr]^{n}_{0}
 \]</span> where <span class="math inline">\([s]^{+} = \max\{s,0\}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\([s]_{0}^n\)</span> is the clip function (defined in <a href="../02">Assignment 2</a>).</p>
<p>We assume that job arrivals <span class="math inline">\(W_t\)</span> follow a Poisson distribution, i.e., <span class="math inline">\(\PR(W_t  = w) = P_w(w) = λ^{w} e^{-λ}/w!\)</span>. When the queue is empty, no job can be completed. When the queue is non-empty, the number of job completions <span class="math inline">\(Z_t\)</span> is a Bernoulli random variable where the success probability <span class="math inline">\(μ(A_t)\)</span>.</p>
<p>There are three components to the per-step cost. (i) there is a holding cost of <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> for every job that is in the queue; (ii) there is a running cost <span class="math inline">\(q(a)\)</span> for choosing rate <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>; and (iii) there is a negative cost (or reward) <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> for every job that is completed. Thus, the per-step cost is <span class="math inline">\(c(S_t,Z_t,A_t)\)</span>, where <span class="math display">\[
     c(s,z,a) = h \cdot s + q(a) - R \cdot z.
 \]</span></p>
<p>Consider the above model with <span class="math inline">\(n = 8\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(m = 3\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(λ = 0.5\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(μ(1) = 0.2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(μ(2) = 0.5\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(μ(3) = 0.8\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(q(1) = 1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(q(2) = 3\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(q(3) = 8\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(h = 1\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(R = 10\)</span>.</p>
<p>Note that in this model, the arrival process is unbounded, which makes it difficult to use the formula that we had in class. To circumvent this difficulty, we pick a bound <span class="math inline">\(B &gt; n\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{w = 0}^B P_w(w)  \approx 1\)</span>. In this exercise, we pick <span class="math inline">\(B = 15\)</span> [Verify that <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> satisfies the above property]. So, we can effectively consider that <span class="math inline">\(W_t\)</span> has a support <span class="math inline">\(\{0, \dots, B\}\)</span>.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Write code (in any programming language) for solving the (approximate) dynamic program for <span class="math inline">\(T = 50\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Plot the value function for <span class="math inline">\(t \in \{1, 5, 10, 25 \}\)</span> on the same plot.</p></li>
<li><p>Plot the optimal policy for <span class="math inline">\(t \in \{1, 5, 10, 25 \}\)</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Submit your code (a PDF listing as well as the source code) with your solution.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>State transmission in Internet of Things</strong></p>
<p>Consider an IoT device which is observing an autoregressive process <span class="math inline">\(\{X_t\}_{t \ge 0}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(X_t \in \integers\)</span>, which starts at <span class="math inline">\(X_1 = 0\)</span> and for <span class="math inline">\(t &gt; 1\)</span> evolves as <span class="math display">\[ X_{t+1} = X_t + W_t \]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\{W_t\}_{t \ge 1}\)</span> is an i.i.d. process with <span class="math inline">\(W_t \in \{ -5, \dots,  5 \}\)</span> with <span class="math display">\[ \PR(W_t = w) =
 \begin{cases}
   \frac{1}{5} - \frac{|w|}{25}, &amp; \text{if } |w| \le 5 \\
   0, &amp; \text{otherwise}
 \end{cases}\]</span></p>
<p>The IoT device can either transmit its observation (denoted by <span class="math inline">\(A_t = 1\)</span>) or not (denoted by <span class="math inline">\(A_t = 0\)</span>). Transmitting a packet has a cost <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> while not transmitting has no cost.</p>
<p>When <span class="math inline">\(A_t = 0\)</span>, the receiver estimates the state of the process as the previously transmitted observation <span class="math inline">\(Z_t\)</span> and incurs a cost <span class="math inline">\((X_t -  Z_t)^2\)</span>.</p>
<p>The above system can be modeled as an MDP with state <span class="math inline">\(\{S_t \}_{t \ge 0}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(S_t = X_t - Z_t\)</span>. It can be shown that the dynamics of <span class="math inline">\(\{S_t\}_{t  \ge 1}\)</span> are as follows: <span class="math display">\[ S_{t+1} = \begin{cases}
     S_t + W_t, &amp; \text{if } A_t = 0 \\
     W_t, &amp; \text{if } A_t = 1
   \end{cases} \]</span></p>
<p>The per-step cost is given by <span class="math display">\[ c(s,a) = \lambda a + (1-a)s^2. \]</span></p>
<p>The objective of this exercise is to find the optimal policy for the above problem using dynamic programming.</p>
<p>In this problem, the state space is unbounded which makes it difficult to use the formula derived in the class. So, we construct approximate dynamics as follows. We pick a large number <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and assume that the dynamics are: <span class="math display">\[ S_{t+1} = \begin{cases}
     [S_t + W_t]_{-B}^B, &amp; \text{if } A_t = 0 \\
     [W_t]_{-B}^B, &amp; \text{if } A_t = 1
   \end{cases} \]</span></p>
<p>In this exercise, we pick <span class="math inline">\(λ = 100\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(λ = 100\)</span>. So, we can effective consider the state space to be <span class="math inline">\(\{-B, \dots, B\}\)</span>.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Write code (in any programming language) for solving the (approximate) dynamic program for <span class="math inline">\(T = 20\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Plot the value function for <span class="math inline">\(t \in \{1, 5, 10, 19 \}\)</span> on the same plot.</p></li>
<li><p>Plot the optimal policy for <span class="math inline">\(t \in \{1, 5, 10, 19 \}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Change the value of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> in the set <span class="math inline">\(\{50, 60, 70, 80 \}\)</span> to make sure that our truncation does not have a significant impact on the value function and the optimal policy.</p></li>

<p>Submit your code (a PDF listing as well as the source code) with your solution.</p></li>
