      <description>So far, we have considered a setup where the decision maker perfectly observes the state of the system. In many applications, the decision maker may not directly observe the state of the system but only observe a noisy version of it. Such systems are modeled as partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). We will describe the simplest model of POMDPs, which builds upon the model of MDPs descibed earlier.
We assume that the system has a state \(X_t \in \ALPHABET X\), control input \(U_t \in \ALPHABET U\), and process noise \(W_t \in \ALPHABET W\).</description>

      <description>Consider a general controlled input output system with two inputs—control action \(U_t\) and disturbance \(W_t\)—and two outputs—observation \(Y_t\) and cost \(C_t\). We assume that the system has an initial state, which we denote by \(X_1\), and assume to be random. We do not assume a state-space model for the system, but simply assume an input-ouput model, i.e., there exist functions \(\{f_t\}_{t \ge 1}\) and \(\{h_t\}_{t \ge 1}\) such that1 \[\begin{equation}\label{eq:Y} Y_t = f_t(X_1, U_{1:t-1}, W_{1:t-1}) \end{equation}\] and \[\begin{equation}\label{eq:C} C_t = h_t(X_1, U_{1:t}, W_{1:t-1}).</description>
