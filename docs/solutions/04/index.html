<div class="h1-title">Assignment 4 (solution)</div>

<h2 data-number="0.1" id="problem-1"><span class="header-section-number">0.1</span> Problem 1</h2>
<p>I had a solution to this problem but the TA found a mistake in my solution. Having thought about it a bit, I realize that as stated the problem cannot be solved.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-unsolvable-math-problem/">urban legends</a> of students solving unsolved problems thinking they were homework questions. That was not my intention! Let me attempt to explain what led to the mistake and how it can be fixed. This requires some background knowledge of communication systems.</p>
<p>As explained in the notes, the model is taken from <span class="citation" data-cites="Berry2000">Berry (<a href="#ref-Berry2000" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a>)</span> but the result was proved by first principle in <span class="citation" data-cites="Berry2000">Berry (<a href="#ref-Berry2000" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a>)</span>. There is one difference between the model in <span class="citation" data-cites="Berry2000">Berry (<a href="#ref-Berry2000" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a>)</span> and the model presented in class. In <span class="citation" data-cites="Berry2000">Berry (<a href="#ref-Berry2000" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a>)</span>, the channel is ordered such that the lowest channel state corresponds to the best channel quality. I have been working on a variation of this model on and off since 2010 (see <a href="http://cim.mcgill.ca/~adityam/projects/communication/conference/2020-wiopt.pdf">this recent conference submission</a> for the details of the model, if you are interested). For reasons that are too complicated to explain in a note, when I started working on the model in 2010, I thought that indexing the channel by saying that the highest state is the best state simplified some of the proofs. So, when I started covering Berry’s model in class, I followed the same modeling assumption.</p>
<p>Now, this change sounds innocuous, but there is a big caveat. The reason why we say that the channel is stochastically monotone is as follows. If the channel has two states, then typically <span class="math display">\[ \PR(\text{GOOD} | \text{GOOD}) \ge \PR(\text{GOOD} | \text{BAD}). \]</span> For the ordering chosen in <span class="citation" data-cites="Berry2000">Berry (<a href="#ref-Berry2000" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a>)</span>, the channel is stochastically monotone. In the ordering that I picked, the channel is the reverse of stochastically monotone. But in my notes I assumed that the channel is stochastic monotone. This leads to some weirdness in the solution of the problem, as stated.</p>
<p>Now, as I said, the proof in <span class="citation" data-cites="Berry2000">Berry (<a href="#ref-Berry2000" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a>)</span> is from first principles. Each time I teach the course, I simplify the proof a little. This year, I realized that the old proof could be considerably simplified if I used the post-decision state model.</p>
<p>Now, in <span class="citation" data-cites="Berry2000">Berry (<a href="#ref-Berry2000" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a>)</span>, the monotonicity of the policy is proved under the assumption that <span class="math inline">\(\{S_t\}_{t \ge 1}\)</span> is i.i.d. It is clear that under that assumption, the post-decision state value function just depends on the queue state <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> and not on the channel state <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>. So, we have <span class="math display">\[ V_t(x) = \min_{u \le x} \bigl\{ p(x)q(s) + Q_t(y-u) \bigr\} \]</span> and it is easy to see that for any fixed <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(g_t(x,s)\)</span> will be monotone in <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now, once I simplified the proof in terms of post-decision state, I believed that I could generalize Berry’s result to stochastically monotone <span class="math inline">\(\{S_t\}_{t \ge 1}\)</span>. My proof seemed to go through and it was relatively simple, so I gave this as a homework assignment. My TA later found a mistake in the proof and having thought about it for a while, I realize that there is no way to prove the result, as stated.</p>
<p>I have <a href="../../mdp/power-delay-tradeoff-2">rewritten the notes</a> to derive the results with the right ordering of channel states. However, in general it is not possible to prove that <span class="math inline">\(p(u)q(s) + H_t(x-u,s)\)</span> is sub- or super-modular. In the updated notes, I explain why this is the case.</p>
<p>I know it is frustrating to get a homework problem which is unsolvable. The only silver lining here is that you get an insight of the fickle nature of getting proofs right. Many a times we think that we have the right proof, only to realize that one of our seemingly obvious looking steps was completely nonsensical.</p>
<h2 data-number="0.2" id="problem-2"><span class="header-section-number">0.2</span> Problem 2</h2>
<p>See <span class="citation" data-cites="Chakravorty2018">Chakravorty and Mahajan (<a href="#ref-Chakravorty2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> for the solution. Most of you got parts (a) and (b) right, but made a mistake in part (c). For part (c), you need to take the sufficient conditions under which the value function and optimal policy of the folder MDP are even and increasing, and translate these sufficient conditions back to the original model. In particular, you need to argue that something equivalent to <span class="math inline">\(S(y|x,u)\)</span> defined in Lemma 2 of the notes should be submodular in <span class="math inline">\((x,u)\)</span></p>
