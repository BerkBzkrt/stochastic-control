## Matrix identities

1. If $(I + M)$ is invertible, then
   $$ M(I + M)^{-1} = I - (I + M)^{-1}. $$
   This can be verified my multiplying both sides with $(I+M)$. 

2. If $(I + MN)$ or, equivalently, $(I + NM)$ is invertible, then
   $$ (I + MN)^{-1} = I - M(I + NM)^{-1}N. $$
   This can be verified by multiplying both sides with $(I + MN)$. This relationship can also be written as:
   $$ (I + MN)^{-1} = I - MN^{1/2}(I + N^{1/2}MN^{1/2})^{-1}N^{1/2}. $$

3. A slight generalization of the above is:
   $$ (I + M T^{-1} N)^{-1} = I - M(T + NM)^{-1}N. $$

4. If $(I + MN)$ or, equivalently, $(I + NM)$ is invertible, then
   $$ N(I + MN)^{-1} = (I + NM)^{-1}N. $$
   This can be verified by left multiplying by $(I + NM)$ and right multiplying by $(I + MN)$.
