### Convergence of expected values
Suppose $X_n \to X$ almost surely. Then, each of the following is a sufficient condition for $\EXP[X_n] \to \EXP[X]$:

1. **Monotone Convergence Theorem.** $0 \le X_1 \le X_2 \cdots$.

2. **Bounded Convergence Theorem.** there exists a constant $b$ such that $|X_n| \le b$ for all $n$.

3. **Dominated Convergence Theorem.** there exists a random variable $Y$ such that $|X_n| \le Y$ almost surely for all $n$ and $\EXP[Y] < âˆž$. 

4. $\{X_n\}_{n \ge 1}$ is uniformly integrable.
