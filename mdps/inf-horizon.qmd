A common way to approximate systems that run for a very large horizon
is to assume that they run for an infinite horizon. There is an inherent
homogeneity over time for infinite horizon system: the future depends only on the
current state and not on the current time. Due to this homogeneity over time,
we expect that the optimal policy should also be time-homogeneous. Therefore,
the optimal policy for an infinite-horizon system should be easier to
implement than the optimal policy for a finite horizon system, especially so
when the horizon is large. This is one of the motivations for studying
infinite horizon models. 

The most common formulation for infinite horizon models is the discounted
setup, where the cost function is assumed to be 
$$ J(π) = \EXP\Bigl[ \sum_{t=1}^\infty γ^{t-1} c_t(S_t, A_t) \Bigr] $$
where $γ \in (0,1)$ is called the discount factor.

#### Discount Factor

The idea of using discounting in MDPs is due to @Blackwell1965.

There are two interpretations of the discount factor $γ$. The first
interpretation is an economic interpretation to determine the _present value_
of a utility that will be received in the future. For example, suppose a
decision maker is indifferent between receiving 1 dollar today or $s$ dollars
tomorrow. This means that the decision maker discounts the future at a rate
$1/s$, so $γ = 1/s$.

The second interpretation is that of an absorbing state. Suppose we
are operating a machine that generates a value of \$1 each day. However,
there is a probability $p$ that the machine will break down at the end of
the day. Thus, the expected return for today is \$1 while the expected
return for tomorrow is $(1-p)$ (which is the probability that the machine
is still working tomorrow). In this case, the discount factor is defined
as $(1-p)$. See @Shwartz2001 for a detailed discussion of this alternative.
:::

In the remainder of this section, we will study how to obtain a solution for
such infinite horizon discounted cost models. 

_Note_: Throughout this section, we assume that $\ALPHABET S$ and $\ALPHABET A$ are
finite and $|\ALPHABET S|= n$ and $|\ALPHABET A| = m$. 

## Performance of a time-homogeneous Markov policy

For any $π \colon \ALPHABET S \to \ALPHABET A$, consider the time homogeneous
policy $(π, π, \dots)$. For ease of notation, we denote this policy simply by
$π$. The expected discounted cost under this policy is given by
$$ V^π(s) = \EXP^π\bigg[ \sum_{t=1}^∞ γ^{t-1} c(S_t, A_t) \biggm| S_1 = s
\bigg].$$

To get a compact expression for this, define a $n × 1$ vector $c_π$ and a $n
× n$ matrix $P_π$ as follows:
$$ [c_π]_s = c(s, π(s))
   \quad\text{and}\quad
   [P_π]_{ss'} = P_{ss'}(π(s)).
$$
Then the dynamics under policy $π$ are Markovian with transition probability
matrix $P_π$ and a cost function $c_π$. Then
$$ \begin{align*}
\EXP^π\big[ c(S_t, π(S_t)) \bigm| S_1 = s \big]
  &= \sum_{s' \in \ALPHABET S} \PR^π(S_t = s' | S_1 = s) c(s', π(s'))
  \\
  &= \sum_{s' \in \ALPHABET S} [P_π^{t-1}]_{ss'} [c_π]_y
  \\
  &= δ_s P_π^{t-1} c_π.
\end{align*} $$

Let $V^π$ denote the $n × 1$ vector given by $[V^π]_s = V^π(s)$. Then,
$$ \begin{align*}
V^π &= c_π + γ P_π c_π + γ^2 P_π^2 c_π + \cdots \\
    &= c_π + γ P_π \big( c_π + γ P_π c_π + \cdots \big) \\
    &= c_π + γ P_π V^π,
\end{align*} $$
which can be rewritten as
$$ (I - γ P_π) V^π = c_π. $$

The [:spectral radius] $ρ(γ P_d)$ of a matrix is upper bounded by its [:spectral
norm] $\lVert γ P_d \rVert = γ < 1$. Therefore, the matrix $(I - γ P_π)$ has an inverse and by left multiplying both sides by $(I - γ P_π)^{-1}$, we get
$$ V^π = (I - γP_π)^{-1} c_π. $$

[:spectral radius]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_radius
[:spectral norm]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_norm

The equation 
$$ V^π = c_π + γ P_π V^π $$
is sometimes also written as
$$ V^π = \BELLMAN^π V^π $$
where the operator $\BELLMAN^π$, which is called the _Bellman operator_,
is an operator from $\reals^n$ to $\reals^n$
given by
$$ \BELLMAN^π v = c_π + γ P_π v.$$

## Bellman operators

:::{#def-Bellman-operator}
Define the _Bellman operator_ $\BELLMAN^* : \reals^n \to \reals^n$ as
follows: for any $v \in \reals^n$
$$ [\BELLMAN^* v]_s = \min_{a \in \ALPHABET A}
\Big\{ c(s,a) + γ \sum_{s' \in \ALPHABET S} P_{ss'}(a) v_y \Big\}.
$$
:::

Note that the above may also be written as[^1]
$$ \BELLMAN^* v = \min_{π \in \Pi} \BELLMAN^π v, $$
where $\Pi$ denotes the set of all deterministic Markov policies. 

[^1]: This is true for general models only when the arg min at each state
  exists.

:::{#prp-Bellman-contraction}
For any $v \in \reals^n$, define the norm $\NORM{V} := \sup_{s \in
\ALPHABET S} \ABS{V^s}$. Then, the Bellman operator is a contraction,
i.e., for any $v, w \in \reals^n$,
$$ \NORM{\BELLMAN^* v - \BELLMAN^* w} \le γ \NORM{v - w}. $$
:::


:::{.callout-note collapse="true"}  
#### Proof {-}

Fix a state $s \in \ALPHABET S$ and consider $[\BELLMAN^* v](s) - [\BELLMAN
w](s)$. In particular, let $a^*$ be the optimal action in the right hand side
of $[\BELLMAN^* w](s)$. Then,
$$\begin{align*}
  [\BELLMAN^* v - \BELLMAN^* w](s) &= 
  \min_{a \in \ALPHABET A}\bigl\{ c(s,a) + γ \sum_{s' \in \ALPHABET S}
  P_{ss'}(a) v(s') \bigr\} - 
  \min_{a \in \ALPHABET A}\bigl\{ c(s,a) + γ \sum_{s' \in \ALPHABET S}
  P_{ss'}(a) w(s') \bigr\} 
  \\
  &\le c(s,a^*) + γ \sum_{s'\in \ALPHABET S} P_{ss'}(a^*) v(s') -
       c(s,a^*) - γ \sum_{s'\in \ALPHABET S} P_{ss'}(a^*) w(s')
  \\
  &\le γ \sum_{s' \in \ALPHABET S} P_{ss'}(a^*) \| v - w \|
  \\
  &= γ \| v - w \|.
\end{align*} $$

By a similar argument, we can show that $[\BELLMAN^* w - \BELLMAN^* v](s) \le
γ \| v - w \|$, which proves the other side of the inequality. 
:::

An immediate consequence of the contraction property is the following.

:::{#thm-Bellman-fixed-point}
There is a unique bounded $V^* \in \reals^n$ that satisfies the 
_Bellman equation_
$$ V = \BELLMAN^* V $$

Moreover, if we start from any $V^0 \in \reals^n$ and recursively define
$$ V^n = \BELLMAN^* V^{n-1} $$
then
$$ \lim_{n \to ∞} V^n = V^*. $$
:::

:::{.callout-note collapse="false"} 
#### Proof {-}
This follows immediately from the [Banach fixed point theorem](https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Banach_Fixed-Point_Theorem).

## Optimal time-homogeneous policy

<!--
::: highlight :::
Prop.

:   Let $μ$ be any (possibly randomized) history dependent policy. Then,      
    there exists a randomized Markov policy $π$ that has the same performance
    as $μ$.
:::

#### Proof {-}

For any policy $μ$, define the _occupation measure_
$$ \mu(s,a | s^∘; μ) 
  := \EXP^μ \bigg[ \sum_{t=1}^∞ γ^{t-1} \IND\{S_t = s, A_t = a\} 
  \biggm| S_1 = s^∘ \bigg]
$$
Then 
$$ J(s^∘; μ) = \sum_{s \in \ALPHABET S, a \in \ALPHABET A}
   μ(s,a | s^∘; μ) c(s,a).
$$ {#eq:performance}

Now, define a randomized Markov policy $π$ as follows:
$$\PR(A_t = a | S_t = s; π) = \frac{ μ(s, a| s^∘; μ) } { μ(s | s^∘; μ) }$$
where $μ(s|s^∘;μ) = \sum_{a \in \ALPHABET A} μ(s,a | s^∘; μ)$. Then, by
construction, 
$ μ(s,a | s^∘; π) = μ(s,a | s^∘; μ) $
and therefore by \\eqref{eq:performance}, we have that $J(s^∘; π) = J(s^∘; μ).$

:::{#prp-value-optimal}
Define 
$$ V^{\text{opt}}_∞(s) := \min_{π} \EXP^π \bigg[ \sum_{t=1}^∞ γ^{t-1} c(S_t, A_t) 
\biggm| S_1 = s \bigg], $$
where the minimum is over all (possibly randomized) history dependent
policies. Then, 
$$ V^{\text{opt}}_∞ = V^*, $$
where $V^*$ is the solution of the Bellman equation.
:::

:::{.callout-note collapse="true"} 
#### Proof {-}

Since the state and action space are finite, without loss of optimality, we
can assume that $0 \le c(s,a) \le M$. 

Consider the finite horizon truncation 
$$ V^{\text{opt}}_T(s) =  \min_{π} \EXP^π\bigg[ \sum_{t=1}^T γ^{t-1} c(S_t, A_t) | S_1 = s \bigg].
$$
From the results for finite horizon MDP, we have that
$$ V^{\text{opt}}_T = \BELLMAN^*^T V^0 $$
where $V^0$ is the all zeros vector. 

Now by construction, 
$$V^{\text{opt}}_∞(s) \ge V^{\text{opt}}_T(s) = [\BELLMAN^*^T V^0](s). $$
Taking limit as $T \to ∞$, we get that
$$\begin{equation}\label{eq:1}
  V^{\text{opt}}_∞(s) \ge \lim_{T \to ∞} [\BELLMAN^*^T V^0](s) = V^*(s). 
\end{equation}$$

Since $0 \le c(s,a) \le M$,  for any $T$,
$$ \begin{align*}
V^{\text{opt}}_∞(s) &\le \min_π \EXP^π \bigg[ \sum_{t=1}^T γ^{t-1} c(S_t, A_t) 
\biggm| S_1 = s \bigg] + \sum_{t=T+1}^∞ γ^{t-1} M \\
&= V^{\text{opt}}_T(s) + γ^T M / (1 - γ) \\
&= [\BELLMAN^*^T V^0](s) + γ^T M / (1-γ). 
\end{align*} $$
Taking limit as $T \to ∞$, we get that
$$\begin{equation}\label{eq:2}
  V^{\text{opt}}_∞(s) \le \lim_{T \to ∞}
  \big\{ [\BELLMAN^*^T V^0](s) + γ^T M / (1-γ) \big\} = V^*(s). 
\end{equation}$$

From \\eqref{eq:1} and \\eqref{eq:2}, we get that $V^{\text{opt}}_∞ = V^*$.

## Properties of Bellman operator

:::{#prp-Bellman-properties}
The Bellman operator satisfies the following properties

* _Monotonicity_. For any $v, w \in \reals^n$, if $v \le w$, then
  $\BELLMAN^π v \le \BELLMAN^π w$ and 
  $\BELLMAN^* v \le \BELLMAN^* w$. 
* _Discounting_. For any $v \in \reals^n$ and $m \in \reals$, 
  $\BELLMAN^π (v + m \ONES) = \BELLMAN^π v + γ m \ONES$
  and 
  $\BELLMAN^* (v + m \ONES) = \BELLMAN^* v + γ m \ONES$.
:::

:::{.callout-note collapse="true"}
#### Proof of monotonicity property {-}
Recall that
$$ \BELLMAN^π v = c_π + γ P_π v. $$
So, monotonicity of $\BELLMAN^π$ follows immediately from monotonicity of
matrix multiplication for positive matrices. 

Let $μ$ be such that $\BELLMAN^* w = \BELLMAN^μ w$. 
Then,
$$ \BELLMAN^* v \le \BELLMAN^μ v 
\stackrel{(a)} \le \BELLMAN^μ w = \BELLMAN^* w,
$$
where $(a)$ uses the monotonicity of $\BELLMAN^μ$. 
:::

:::{.callout-note collapse="true"}  
#### Proof of discounting property {-}
Recall that
$$ \BELLMAN^π v = c_π + γ P_π v. $$
Thus,
$$ \BELLMAN^π(v+m \ONES) = c_π + γ P_π (v+m \ONES) = c_π + γ P_π v + γ m
\ONES = \BELLMAN^π
v + γ m \ONES.$$ 
Thus, $\BELLMAN^π$ is discounting. Now consider 
$$ \BELLMAN^* (v + m \ONES ) = \min_{π} \BELLMAN^π (v+m \ONES)
= \min_π \mathcal (B_π v + γ m \ONES) = \BELLMAN^* v + γ m \ONES.$$
Thus, $\BELLMAN^*$ is discounting.
:::

:::{#prp-Bellman-coarse-bounds}
For any $V \in \reals^n$,

* If $V \ge \BELLMAN^* V$, then $V \ge V^*$;
* If $V \le \BELLMAN^* V$, then $V \le V^*$;
* If $V = \BELLMAN^* V$, then $V$ is the only vector with this property
  and $V = V^*$.

The same bounds are true when $(\BELLMAN^*, V^*)$ is replaced with
$(\BELLMAN^π, V^π)$. 
:::

:::{.callout-note collapse="true"} 
#### Proof {-}
We prove the first part. The proof of the other parts is similar.

We are given that
$$V \ge \BELLMAN^* V.$$ 
Then, by monotonicity of the Bellman operator, 
$$ \BELLMAN^* V \ge \BELLMAN^*^2 V.$$ 
Continuing this way, we get
$$ \BELLMAN^*^k V \ge \BELLMAN^*^{k+1} V.$$
Adding the above equations, we get
$$ V \ge \BELLMAN^*^{k+1} V.$$
Taking limit as $k \to ∞$, we get 
$$V \ge V^*.$$
:::

:::{#prp-Bellman-bounds}
For any $V \in \reals^n$ and $m \in \reals$, 

* If $V + m \ONES \ge \BELLMAN^* V$, then $V  + m \ONES/(1-γ) \ge V^*$;
* If $V + m \ONES \le \BELLMAN^* V$, then $V  + m \ONES/(1-γ) \le V^*$;

The same bounds are true when $(\BELLMAN^*, V^*)$ is replaced with
$(\BELLMAN^π, V^π)$. 
:::

:::{.callout-tip}
#### Remark
The above result can also be stated as follows:

* $\displaystyle \| V^π - V \| \le \frac{1}{1-γ}\| \BELLMAN^π V - V \|$.
* $\displaystyle \| V^* - V \| \le \frac{1}{1-γ}\| \BELLMAN^* V - V \|$.
:::

:::{.callout-note collapse="true"}  
#### Proof {-}
Again, we only prove the first part. The proof of the second part is the same. We have that
$$ V + m \ONES \ge \BELLMAN^* V. $$
From discounting and monotonicity properties, we get
$$ \BELLMAN^* V + γ m \ONES \ge \BELLMAN^*^2 V. $$
Again, from discounting and monotonitiy properties, we get
$$ \BELLMAN^*^2 V + γ^2 m \ONES \ge \BELLMAN^*^3 V. $$
Continuing this way, we get
$$ \BELLMAN^*^k V + γ^k m \ONES \ge \BELLMAN^*^{k+1} V. $$
Adding all the above equations, we get
$$ V + \sum_{\ell = 0}^k γ^\ell m \ONES \ge \BELLMAN^*^{k+1} V. $$
Taking the limit as $k \to ∞$, we get
$$ V + m \ONES/(1-γ) \ge V^*. $$

## Countable or continuous state and action spaces 

The discussion above was restricted to finite state and action spaces. In general, when working with non-finite state and action spaces, we need to be careful about existence of solutions. See @sec-mdp-cts-spaces  for a discussion. 

For infinite horizon problems, there are additional technical challenges. We first point out via examples that the Bellman equation may not have a _unique_ fixed point equation.

:::{#exm-Bertsekas-linear-dp-soln}
### Phantom solutions of DP [@Bertsekas:book]
Consider an MDP with $\ALPHABET S = [0,∞)$, $\ALPHABET A = \{a_\circ\}$ (dummy action), $p(ds'\mid s,a) = δ_{s' - s/γ}$ (so the state deterministically transitions to $s/γ$) and $c(s,a) ≡ 0$. It is clear that the optimal value function $V^*(s) ≡ 0$. However, the dynamic programming equation is
$$
  V^*(s) = γ V^*(s/γ)
$$
and is satisfied by any linear function $V^*(s) = α s$!
:::

:::{.callout-warning}
### Did we just violate the Banach fixed point theorem? 

To apply the Banach fixed point theorem, we need to be in a Banach space, i.e., a complete normed metric space. So, what was the Banach space in @thm-Bellman-fixed-point? Implicitly, we had used the space 
$$
  \ALPHABET V^M \coloneqq \{ v \colon \ALPHABET S \to \reals \text{ such that } \| v \|_{∞} \le M \}
$$
where $M$ is any constant greater than $\|c\|_{∞}/(1-γ)$. Banach fixed point theorem says that DP has a **unique** fixed point in $\ALPHABET V^M$. It does not say anything about solutions outside $\ALPHABET V^M$!

Among all the solutions, only the one corresponding to $α = 0$ is bounded, which is also the optimal value function.
:::

:::{#exm-birth-death-dp-solution}
Consider a birth-death Markov chain with $0$ as an aborbing state. In particular, $\ALPHABET S = \integers_{\ge 0}$, $\ALPHABET A = \{a_\circ\}$ (dummy action), and $c(s,a) = \IND\{s > 0\}$. The transition dynamics are given by: for $s = 0$, $P(s'|0,a) = \IND\{s' = 0\}$ and for $s > 0$, we have
$$
P(s'|s,a) = p \IND\{ s' = s+1\} + (1-p) \IND\{s' = s-1\}.
$$
So, the DP is given by $v(0) = 0$ and for $s > 0$
$$
V^*(s) = 1 + γ p  V^*(s+1) + γ(1-p) V^*(s-1),
$$
which is a harmonic equation and has a generic solution of the form:
$$
  V^*(s) = \frac{1}{1-γ} - 
  \biggl[ \frac{1}{1-γ} + C \biggr] q_1^s +
  C q_2^s
$$
where $C$ is an arbitrary constant and 
$$
  q_{1,2} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 - 4 γ^2 p (1-p)}}{2 γp}.
$$
It can be verified that $q_1 \in (0,1)$ and $q_2 \in (1,∞)$. So, every solution except $C = 0$ is unbounded.

Again we have multiple solutions of the DP and the correct solution is the only bounded solution (which corresponds to $C = 0$).
