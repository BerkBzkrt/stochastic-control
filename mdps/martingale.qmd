title: A Martingale principle of optimal control
---

There is a relationship between optimal control and martingale theory. 
Let $\mathcal{F}_t = σ(S_{1:t}, A_{1:t-1})$ denote the information available to the decision maker at time $t$. Note that the actions $\{A_t\}_{t \ge 1}$ are $\{\mathcal{F}_t\}_{t \ge 1}$-adapted. 

Let's revisit the example of [optimal gambling][gambling].
$$
  S_t = S_1 + \sum_{\tau=1}^{t-1} A_\tau W_\tau,
$$
where $A_\tau \in [0, S_{\tau})$ is $\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable. Define 
$$
  Z_t = \log(S_t) - \alpha t
$$
where 
$α = H(\tfrac 12) - H(p)$ with $H(p) = -p \log p - (1-p) \log(1-p)$ being the binary entropy function. Note that 
\begin{align*}
  \EXP[ Z_{t+1} \mid \mathcal{F}_t ] &= 
  \EXP[ \log(S_{t} + A_t W_t) \mid \mathcal{F}_t
\end{align*}
