# <i class="bi bi-journal-text text-primary"></i> Summary
The [Riccati update] for [LQ systems] has a complexity $\mathcal O(d_x^3)$, which $d_x$ is the size of the state space. So even computing the otimal gains in a large-scale system is computationally challenging. In this section we show that under certain regularity and symmetry assumptions, the optimal solution of a large-scale system can be computed with low complexity.

## Mean-field control

Consider a system consisting of $N$ subsystems, indexed by the set $\ALPHABET N \coloneqq \{1, \dots, N\}$. Each subsystem $i \in \ALPHABET N$ has a state $x^i_t \in \reals^{d_x}$ and a control input $u^i_t \in \reals^{d_u}$. The dynamics of each subsystem are given as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:dynamics}
  x^i_{t+1} = A x^i_t + B u^i_t + D \bar x_t + E \bar u_t + w^i_t
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation}
  \bar x_t \coloneqq \frac 1N \sum_{i \in \ALPHABET N} x^i_t
  \quad\text{and}\quad
  \bar u_t \coloneqq \frac 1N \sum_{i \in \ALPHABET N} u^i_t
\end{equation}
are the _emperical mean-field_ of the state and control, respectively and $A$, $B$, $D$, $E$ are matrices of appropriate dimensions. The noise processes $\{w^i_t\}_{t \ge 1}$, $i \in \ALPHABET N$ are correlated across subsystem but are assumed to be independent across time. 

We use $\pmb x_t \coloneqq (x^1_t, \dots, x^N_t)$ and $\pmb u_t \coloneqq(u^1_t, \dots, u^N_t)$ to denote the global state and control of the system. The system incurs a per-step cost given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mf-cost}
  c(\pmb x_t, \pmb u_t) = 
  \bar x_t^\TRANS \bar Q \bar x_t + \bar u_t^\TRANS \bar R \bar u_t
  +
  \frac 1N \sum_{i \in \ALPHABET N}
  \bigl[
  (x^i_t)^\TRANS Q x^i_t + (u^i_t)^\TRANS R u^i_t
  \bigr]
\end{equation}
and a terminal cost
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mf-cost-T}
  c_T(\pmb x_T) = 
  \bar x_T^\TRANS \bar Q_T \bar x_T 
  +
  \frac 1N \sum_{i \in \ALPHABET N}
  (x^i_T)^\TRANS Q_T x^i_T 
\end{equation}

We are interested in identifying policies $g = (g_1, \dots, g_{T-1})$ where $\pmb u_t = g_t(\pmb x_t)$ to minimize
\begin{equation}\label{eq:performance}
  J(g) = \EXP^g\biggl[\sum_{t=1}^{T-1} c(\pmb x_t, \pmb u_t) + c_T(\pmb x_T)
  \biggr]
\end{equation}

### Weakly coupled dynamics and cost

Note that the subsystems are weakly coupled in the dynamics and cost. A naive solution using by solving a single Riccati equation has a complexity of $\mathcal O(d_x^3 N^3)$, which scales cubically in the number of agents.

### State space decomposition

We now present a decomposition method to simplify the above optimization problem. Note that \eqref{eq:dynamics} implies that
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mf-dynamics}
  \bar x_t = (A + D) \bar x_t + (B + E) \bar u_t + \bar w_t
\end{equation}
where $\bar w_t = (\sum_{i \in \ALPHABET N}w^i_t)/N$. Define
$$
  \breve x^i_t = x^i_t - \bar x_t
  \quad\text{and}\quad
  \breve u^i_t = u^i_t - \bar u_t.
$$
Then, subtracting \eqref{eq:mf-dynamics} from \eqref{eq:dynamics}, we get
\begin{equation}\label{eq:breve-dynamics}
  \breve x^i_t = A \breve x^i_t + B \breve u^i_t + \breve w^i_t
\end{equation}
where $\breve w^i_t = w^i_t - \bar w_t$. 

We can think of $\bar x_t$ as the "center of mass" of the system and $\breve x^i_t$ to be the relative coordinates of subsystem $i$ wrt the center of mass. Building on this intuition, we make the following simple observation, which may be viewed as an analog of the [:parallel axis theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_axis_theorem) in physics.

:::{#lem-parallel-axis-theorem}
We have the following:

1. $\displaystyle \frac 1N\sum_{i \in \ALPHABET N} (x^i_t)^\TRANS Q x^i_t
   = 
   \bar x_t^\TRANS Q \bar x_t
   +
   \frac 1N \sum_{i \in \ALPHABET N} (\breve x^i_t)^\TRANS Q \breve x^i_t$.
2. $\displaystyle \frac 1N\sum_{i \in \ALPHABET N} (u^i_t)^\TRANS Q u^i_t
   = 
   \bar u_t^\TRANS Q \bar u_t
   +
   \frac 1N \sum_{i \in \ALPHABET N} (\breve u^i_t)^\TRANS Q \breve u^i_t$.

### Proof
The proof follows from the observation that $\sum_{i \in \ALPHABET N} \breve x^i_t = 0$ and elementary algebra.
:::

An immediate implication of @lem-parallel-axis-theorem is that the per-step cost can be decomposed as follows:
\begin{equation}
  c(\pmb x_t, \pmb u_t) = \bar c(\bar x_t, \bar u_t) + 
  \frac 1N \sum_{i \in \ALPHABET N} \breve c^i(\breve x^i_t, \breve u^i_t)
\end{equation}
where
\begin{align*}
  \bar c(\bar x_t, \bar u_t) &=
  \bar x_t^\TRANS (Q + \bar Q) \bar x_t + \bar u_t^\TRANS (R + \bar R) \bar u_t,
  \notag \\
  \breve c^i(\breve x^i_t, \breve u^i_t) &=
   \frac 1N \sum_{i \in \ALPHABET N}
   \bigl[
    (\breve x^i_t)^\TRANS Q \breve x^i_t
    +
    (\breve u^i_t)^\TRANS Q \breve u^i_t
  \bigr].
\end{align*}
A similar decomposition also holds for the terminal cost $c_t(\pmb x_t, \pmb u_t)$. 

Thus, the original system is equivalent to $N+1$ coupled subsystems: 

- a mean-field subsystem with state $\bar x_t$, control input $\bar u_t$, and per-step cost $\bar c(\bar x_t, \bar u_t)$.
- $N$ auxiliary subsytems, where subsystem $i \in \ALPHABET N$ has state $\breve x^i_t$, control input $\breve u^i_t$, and per-step cost $\breve c(\breve x^i_t, \breve u^i_t)$.

Note that the only coupling between the subsystems is through the noise. Therefore, by the argument presented in @exr-lqr-noise-coupled, the optimal control strategy is of the following form.

:::{#prp-mf-control}
  The optimal control policy for the mean-field control system described above is given by
  $$
    u_t = - \bar K_t \bar x_t + \breve K_t (x^i_t - \bar x_t)
  $$
  where 

  - $\bar K_{1:T-1} = \LQR_T(A+D, B+E, Q + \bar Q, R + \bar R; Q_T + \bar Q_T)$
  - $\breve K_{1:T-1} = \LQR_T(A,B, Q, R; Q_T)$.

### Significance of the result

The above result is significant, both for synthesis and implementation. 

For synthesis, rather than solving one Riccati equation with state dimension $nN$, we need to solve two Riccati equations with dimension $d_x$. Thus, the complexity of computing the optimal controller gains does not depend on the number $N$ of subsystems.

For implementation, each subsystem does not need access to the global state $\pmb x_t$; instead it just needs access to the mean-field $\bar x_t$ in addition to its local state $x^i_t$.

## Notes {-}

The results for mean-field control are adapted from @Arabneydi2016. The discussion above is restricted to the simplest setting of homogenous subsystems. Generalization to hetrogeneous subsystems and infinite horizon settings are also presented in @Arabneydi2016. A similar result for $N \to \infty$ is also presented in @Elliott2013. 

The results for network coupled subsystems are adapted from @Gao2022.
