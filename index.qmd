# About the course {.unnumbered}

These notes started as the lecture notes for ECSE 506 (Stochastic Control and Decision Theory) that I teach in the Winter term of every even year. These notes are not meant to be exhaustive; rather my focus is to convey the key ideas in their simplest form. For a more exhaustive treatment of the subject, please refer to the reference books mentioned below.
